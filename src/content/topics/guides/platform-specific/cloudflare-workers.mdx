## Overview

This guide explains how to connect LaunchDarkly to Cloudflare Workers using [LaunchDarkly's Cloudflare Edge SDK](/sdk/server-side/node-js/cloudflare-edge-sdk).

Cloudflare Workers are serverless functions that run "at the edge" within Cloudflare's Content Delivery Network (CDN). Unlike traditional serverless functions that are deployed to a single region, edge functions like Cloudflare Workers are deployed across a global CDN network. This means that users' requests are routed to the nearest CDN, allowing the function response to be extremely fast.

LaunchDarkly provides a Cloudflare Workers integration that synchronizes flags and flag values with Cloudflare, which makes accessing flag values from within a Worker available without any processing delay. This allows you to use flag values within a Worker without incurring even the minimal cost of retrieving those values from the LaunchDarkly server.

This guide explains how to get set up within Cloudflare and set up the LaunchDarkly integration. It also contains several examples of using LaunchDarkly flags within a Worker to alter the response sent back to the user based upon flag values.

## Getting set up

For this guide, we created a sample CloudFlare Workers project that demonstrates several uses of flags within a Worker. The finished code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/launchdarkly-labs/cfworkers-ld). You can use this code as a reference as you work through the steps in the guide. You can view the finished page running on [Cloudflare Workers](https://cfworkers-ld.remotesynth.workers.dev/).

To create the project documented in this guide, clone the site assets from [this Github repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly-labs/cfworkers-ld-assets). The assets contain the code for the website without the Worker file or the custom client-side JavaScript that appear in the examples below.

To compile the site, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), a static site generator built in Go. The easiest way to install Hugo is using Homebrew on Mac.

Here's how to install Hugo:

To install Hugo:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Homebrew', value: 'bash', },
    { label: 'Chocolatey', value: 'chocolatey', }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="bash">

```bash
brew install hugo
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="chocolatey">

```bash
choco install hugo -confirm
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Setting up Cloudflare CLI

The quickest way to get set up with Cloudflare Workers locally is to use npm to install [Cloudflare's Worker CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update), which is called Wrangler.

To install Wrangler:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @cloudflare/wrangler
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install it, use the `wrangler login` command to open a browser window. Use the window to log into your Cloudflare account to authenticate the CLI. For additional CLI authentication methods, read the [Wrangler docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/authentication).

### Setting up local development for Cloudflare Workers

This guide uses [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/sites) that allow you to deploy an application but with a static site generator (SSG) or front end framework to a worker. You can publish a simple static site built with the [Hugo SSG](https://gohugo.io) by following Cloudflare's documentation on [starting from an existing project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/sites/start-from-existing).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Only use a supported version of Wrangler</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Wrangler 2 beta supports a new, streamlined Workers integration with Pages, Cloudflare's solution for deploying sites. However, the Cloudflare Pages integration with Workers does not allow for providing a custom Webpack configuration, which is required for LaunchDarkly's Cloudflare Edge SDK. We recommend not using the beta to complete this guide.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Open the folder containing the site assets from GitHub and enter the following command:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Console', value: 'bash', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="bash">

```bash
wrangler init --site my-static-site
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

This creates a `wrangler.toml` and a `workers-site` directory within the `my-static-site` project. Next, tell the worker to find the site files in the `/public` folder, which is where Hugo outputs them by default.

To do this, open the `wrangler.toml` and add the following line:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="toml"
  values={[
    { label: 'wrangler.toml', value: 'toml', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="toml">

```toml
site = { bucket = "./public" }
```

  </CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can run the site locally using Wrangler, even though you haven't created a Worker yet. The first step is to use Hugo to build the site and then run a local server with Wrangler.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Console', value: 'bash', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="bash">

```bash
hugo
wrangler dev
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can view the site at the URL and port indicated in the console, typically `localhost:8787`.

### Using a simple Cloudflare Worker

Wrangler generates a Cloudflare Worker for you. The Worker contains a lot of extraneous code that you don't need for this guide. You can replace the existing worker code in `/worker-site/index.js` with the simplified code below. This makes it easier to update using the examples in the remainder of this guide.

The Worker gets the existing page content from the Cloudflare's key value store (KV) where all the site's assets are cached and returns that in the response to the user's browser.

Here's what it looks like:

<CodeTabs
    defaultValue="js"
    values={[
        { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
    ]
    }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import { getAssetFromKV } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleEvent(event))
})

async function handleEvent(event) {
  let options = {}

  try {
    const page = await getAssetFromKV(event, options)
    const response = new Response(page.body, page)

    return response
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
    return new Response(e.message || e.toString(), { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Setting up the LaunchDarkly Cloudflare integration

LaunchDarkly's Cloudflare integration synchronizes flag data from a LaunchDarkly project and environment with a KV connected to your Worker in Cloudflare. This means that it makes the latest flag data immediately available to the LaunchDarkly client within your Worker without the need for additional external calls. This makes it extremely fast.

To set up the integration, you need a minimum of one KV created to sync values with. To set this up, first make sure that your account ID is in the `wrangler.toml` that the Wrangler CLI created. Your account ID is listed on the overview page of the Cloudflare Workers dashboard, or you can get it by using `wrangler whoami` from the command line.

To check if your account ID is in the `wrangler.toml`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="toml"
  values={[
    { label: 'wrangler.toml', value: 'toml', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="toml">

```toml
account_id = "<YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID>"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Copy and store your account ID as you need it to enable the Cloudflare integration.

Next, create a new KV namespace by entering the following command. Run this command from within your project folder:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Console', value: 'bash', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="bash">

```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create "MY_KV"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The namespace name on Cloudflare is a combination of the name you provided (`MY_KV`) and the project name. For example, if your project is named `cfworkers-ld`, the name of the created namespace on Cloudflare will be `cfworkers-ld-MY_KV`. After the namespace is created, Wrangler returns the ID of the new KV namespace.

Open `wrangler.toml` and add the namespace ID to the `kv_namespaces` configuration. If this configuration key does not exist yet, create it. If it does exist with the KV namespace that was created for your site assets, add the new namespace to the array of namespaces.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="toml"
  values={[
    { label: 'wrangler.toml', value: 'toml', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="toml">

```toml
kv_namespaces = [{((binding = 'MY_KV'), (id = '<NAMESPACE_ID>'))},
{
  ((binding = 'SITE_ASSETS'),
  (preview_id = '43ecd3c7d05f45caa947fb48fd7b7c83'),
  (id = 'a0a8f76d2fe14947826adc1453c2e90c'))
}
, ]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Copy and store the namespace ID as you'll need it to enable LaunchDarkly's Cloudflare integration.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Cloudflare Workers preview service</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you plan to use the [Cloudflare Workers preview service](https://cloudflareworkers.com/), you will need to create a preview namespace as well. To set this up, follow the [Cloudflare integration docs](/integrations/cloudflare#creating-a-cloudflare-worker-with-the-launchdarkly-cloudflare-edge-sdk).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The last piece of information you'll need to enable Cloudflare integration is a Cloudflare API token. From the Workers overview page in the Cloudflare dashboard, under "Get started" on the right-hand navigation links, click [**API tokens**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Then click **Create Token**.

Next, click the "Get started" button next to the "Create custom token" option.

![The Create custom token option.](CF-SDK-custom-token.png)

Give the token a name (for example, "LaunchDarkly") and then under "Permissions" choose the following options from the dropdowns:

1. Account
2. Workers KV Storage
3. Edit

![Cloudflare token permissions on the Create Custom Token screen.](CF-SDK-token-creation.png)

Click **Continue to Summary** and then **Create Token**. Copy the token from the subsequent page and store it, as it will not be shown again.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Creating a Cloudflare API token</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

For detailed instructions on creating a token, read the [Cloudflare docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Next, set up the integration within the LaunchDarkly dashboard. Go to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations/) and search for Cloudflare. Click the "Add integration" button. A form requesting the following details appears:

- **Name**: This is optional, but is useful for determining which Worker namespace this is connected to when you have multiple connections.
- **Environment**: Which LaunchDarkly environment to use when syncing flags and values with the KV on Cloudflare.
- **Account ID**: Your Cloudflare account ID.
- **KV Namespace ID**: The namespace ID for the KV connected to your Worker. If you also created a preview KV, you'll need a separate integration set up using the preview KV namespace ID as well.
- **API token**: The Cloudflare API token you just created.

![The LaunchDarkly Edit Cloudflare configuration screen.](CF-SDK-integration.png)

Click the "Save configuration" button. If you want to verify that the information is correct, click the "Validate Connection" button. If everything connected properly, you're ready to begin adding LaunchDarkly into your Worker.

### Initializing LaunchDarkly within a Worker

Before you can get flag values from within a Worker, you need to import and initialize the Cloudflare Edge SDK.

Begin by installing the SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="bash"
  values={[
    { label: 'Console', value: 'bash', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="bash">

```bash
npm install launchdarkly-cloudflare-edge-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Open the `index.js` file within the `workers-site` folder of your project. This folder was created by the `wrangler init` command you ran earlier. If you don't have an `index.js` file, create it now. At the top of the file, add the `require` statement to import the SDK into the Worker file. In addition, initialize the variable that will contain the instance of the LaunchDarkly client when it is initialized.

To initialize the variable:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const { init } = require('launchdarkly-cloudflare-edge-sdk')
let ldClient
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Within your Worker, there is an event listener for the `fetch` event that calls a `handleEvent()` function. The `fetch` event is triggered by any incoming HTTP request. You can initialize the LaunchDarkly client within this function. Pass to it the KV namespace defined within your `wrangler.toml` and your LaunchDarkly client ID, which can be found in your [account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
if (!ldClient) {
  ldClient = init(MY_KV, '<LAUNCHDARKLY_CLIENT_ID>')
  await ldClient.waitForInitialization()
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Now you are ready to use flag variations within your application.

### Cloudflare's HTMLRewriter class

The examples below make use of a powerful feature that Cloudflare Workers provides called [HTMLRewriter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter). HTMLRewriter is a JavaScript class that you can leverage within Cloudflare Worker code to modify the content of the response it sends back to the user. This lets you to do things like modify the page's HTML or change text in the response. This section explains some of the basics of HTMLRewriter so you can understand the code in the examples below.

Here's how to construct a new instance of the HTMLRewriter class:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

An instance of HTMLRewriter provides two functions:

1. `on()` listens for any selected elements on the page. [Selectors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter#selectors) select elements that offer a subset of standard [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors), which are commonly used for selecting elements with the document object model (DOM). It passes each matching element to the element handler that you define.
2. `onDocument()` responds to the entire HTML document, passing the contents of that document to a document handler that you specify.

Corresponding to the above, there are two types of handlers:

1. [Element handlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter#element-handlers) specify the code that runs on each matching element the selector specified in `on()` returns. You can use this to add, update, or remove matching elements and content from within the HTML response.
2. [Document handlers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter#document-handlers) specify the code that runs when it receives the entire HTML document. You can use this to modify the doctype, modify the text, or add code that runs at the end of the document.

Two of the below examples make use of element handlers to modify the HTML response with a Cloudflare Worker before it is ever received by the end user. To learn more about HTMLRewriter, read the [Cloudflare docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter).

## Bootstrapping client-side flag values

A persistent problem with modifying the client UI on the web using JavaScript is the delay between when the UI initially renders an element and when the update runs in the script. This causes a "flash" of initial content, where the initial rendering flashes on screen before the UI updates it. A common example of this is login/sign up links briefly rendering before getting updated with the logged-in user's information.

Imagine a scenario using a LaunchDarkly flag to enable or disable a feature within the browser UI. You definitely do not want the feature to display, however briefly, before disappearing. This could cause confusion and possibly frustration on the part of the user. While LaunchDarkly's client SDKs provide tools caching in LocalStorage to minimize these types of issues, the nature of how JavaScript runs in the browser means that any fully client-side solution cannot completely eliminate the delay, though there are methods to obscure it. Cloudflare Workers allow you to actually eliminate that delay by directly injecting your client-side flag values into the HTML before the browser ever receives the request.

Within your Cloudflare Worker file, first instantiate an instance of the HTMLRewriter class. You can place this prior to the `addEventListener()` block within `/workers-site/index.js`.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Inject these values in the HTML `<head>` so that they are available immediately before the browser engine processes any of the DOM or JavaScript. You can do this by having the HTMLRewriter listen for the head element. Place this directly after the `rewriter` instantiation.

To inject the values:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
rewriter.on('head', new FlagsStateInjector())
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

When the rewriter finds a `<head>` element, it creates a new instance of the `FlagStateInjector` class. This class contains an element handler that injects the flag values into a `<script>` element within the `<head>`. In this example, the LaunchDarkly client is only pulling flag values that have client-side SDK availability enabled using an anonymous user. If you have user details available within your Worker, you can pass them here instead of the anonymous user. This code can be placed anywhere within the Worker file that is outside of existing function blocks.

In this example, the code is at the top of the file immediately after the `ldClient` variable instantiation:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
class FlagsStateInjector {
  async element(element) {
    // fetch all flag values for client-side SDKs as evaluated for an anonymous user
    // use a more appropriate user key if needed
    const user = { key: 'anonymous' }
    const allFlags = await ldClient.allFlagsState(user, {
      clientSideOnly: true,
    })
    element.append(`<script>window.ldFlags = ${JSON.stringify(allFlags)}</script>`, { html: true })
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The last small change you need to make to your Worker is to call the HTMLRewriter instance to alter the response. Instead of returning just `response` from within the `handleEvent()` method, wrap it in the rewriter's `transform()` method.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
return rewriter.transform(response)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Finally, tell LaunchDarkly to [bootstrap the client](/guides/platform-specific/static-sites#bootstrapping-the-client) using the injected script.

Open the `/assets/custom.js` file and add the following code at the top of the file, replacing `<LAUNCHDARKLY_CLIENT_ID>` with your LaunchDarkly project's client ID:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const client = LDClient.initialize(
  '<LAUNCHDARKLY_CLIENT_ID>',
  {
    key: 'anonymous',
  },
  {
    bootstrap: window.ldFlags,
  },
)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Because the flag values are automatically synced between LaunchDarkly and the KV store, every time this page is served it automatically injects the current flag state values before it sends the page to the end user. This eliminates any flash of content caused even by a very brief rendering delay between when the UI initially displays, and when the LaunchDarkly client receives flag values that are used to update the user interface.

After you've bootstrapped the client, you can use the LaunchDarkly SDK client as you normally would. For example, the following code, when you add it to `/assets/custom.js`, initializes the SDK, gets the value of a boolean flag named `show-about-us`, and then calls the `showAboutUs()` method to either hide or display the "About Us" section of the home page.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const client = LDClient.initialize('<LAUNCHDARKLY_CLIENT_ID>', {
  key: 'anonymous',
})
client.on('ready', async function () {
  const showAboutUs = await client.variation('show-about-us', false)
  displayAboutUs(showAboutUs)
})

client.on('change', async function () {
  const showAboutUs = await client.variation('show-about-us', false)
  displayAboutUs(showAboutUs)
})
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Because the value of `show-about-us` is bootstrapped in the client, there is no latency when getting the initial flag value and displaying the content to the user. In addition, because the code watches for the `change` event, any changes to the flag once the page is loaded are reflected immediately.

## Modifying content at the edge

You can use Cloudflare Workers to modify the content being served to an end user at the CDN level, before they ever receive it in their browser client. This can be useful to do things like [A/B testing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/ab-testing), [fetching an HTML or API response](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/fetch-html), targeting content based upon user data, or personalizing content for an authenticated user.

The below example shows how to use the value of a string flag to replace the header text on a page. This type of solution could be modified for use in A/B testing, for slowly rolling out content changes, or for personalizing content.

First, create a string flag in LaunchDarkly that has two variations containing the header text. You do not need to enable it for client-side SDKs since you'll be calling it within a Worker function.

To create a string flag in LaunchDarkly, choose the "String" option under flag variations as shown in the illustration below:

![The Create a feature flag screen with string flag options chosen.](CF-SDK-create-string-flag.png)

Within the Worker, you can reuse the LaunchDarkly client you created in the prior example. However, since you'll get flag values in multiple places, it can be easier to create a single function to handle asynchronously retrieving the flag values. The following function passes in a user `key` and a `user` object and returns the value of the flag for that user. If you do not pass a user, it defaults to `anonymous` as a user key. You can place this function anywhere within the `/workers-site/index.js` Worker file that is outside an existing code block.

In this example, it is just prior to the `addEventListener` function block:

<CodeTabs
    defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
async function getFlagValue(key, user) {
  let flagValue
  if (!user) {
    user = {
      key: 'anonymous',
    }
  }
  flagValue = await ldClient.variation(key, user, false)
  return flagValue
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next, create an element handler to modify the DOM element that you want to populate with the returned value of the string flag in LaunchDarkly. In the below example, the element handler is called for every `<h1>` element within the page HTML. Use the same instance of `HTMLRewriter` from the above example. Trying to create more than one instance of `HTMLRewriter` in a single Worker causes errors.

Place the following line immediately after the `rewriter.on()` call from the prior example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
rewriter.on('h1', new H1ElementHandler())
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, the element handler gets the value of the flag named `header-text` and replaces the text within the `<h1>` tag with the result.

Place this code following the existing `FlagsStateInjector` block from the prior example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
class H1ElementHandler {
  async element(element) {
    // replace the header text with the value of a string flag
    const headerText = await getFlagValue('header-text')
    element.setInnerContent(headerText)
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The result is shown in the below video clip that demonstrates how changing the flag in LaunchDarkly will trigger the Worker to alter the text response in the `h1` tag before the page is received by the user. Because the change happens within the Worker, the user must refresh the page to reflect any flag change after the user has already received the page source.

## Modifying the response headers for a response

Modifying the response headers for a response can be a powerful tool. You can use it to change existing headers for testing purposes, add custom headers that your code can respond to, or even redirect a user to a different page. In this example, you'll use a JSON flag value in LaunchDarkly to create an object containing the custom headers you want to add to the response using a Cloudflare Worker.

First, create a JSON flag in LaunchDarkly. JSON flags can contain any valid, arbitrary JSON data. In the example below, the flag contains an array of request header names and values. In one case, a `x-launchdarkly-hello` header is set, while in the other it is not.

![The Create a feature flag screen with JSON flag options chosen.](CF-SDK-json-flag.png)

Next, get the flag value. Since the result of getting the flag is an array of objects, the code below loops through each item in the array and sets a header for the response for each item found in the array.

This code should go within the `handleEvent` function prior to the `return` within the `try` block:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
      { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', }
  ]
  }>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
// allow headers to be altered
const response = new Response(page.body, page)

const customHeader = await getFlagValue('custom-response-headers')
customHeader.headers.forEach(header => {
  response.headers.set(header.name, header.value)
})
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

As shown highlighted in the image below, when the flag is turned on, the user receives an `x-launchdarkly-hello` response header with the value of "Hello from LaunchDarkly".

![Viewing custom response headers.](CF-SDK-custom-headers.png)

## Conclusion

Cloudflare Workers offer a great way to deploy serverless code "to the edge", meaning they are deployed to a CDN and served to your end users from the CDN servers closest to their location. This makes them incredibly fast and a great way to perform all sorts of logic and processing on the user's request and response as it is in flight. If you're wondering what else you can do with Cloudflare Workers, read their [list of examples](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples), including things like sending a [conditional response](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/conditional-response) or [rewriting links](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/rewrite-links).

Combining Workers with LaunchDarkly feature management is a powerful combination, offering you the ability to bootstrap client-side flags with zero latency or allowing you to control how your code runs at the edge in Cloudflare simply by flipping a flag.
