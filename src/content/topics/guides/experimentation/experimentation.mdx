In this guide, you will:

- Configure an SDK,
- Create a multivariate flag,
- Configure the flag's targeting rules,
- Create a metric,
- Build an experiment, and
- Run and analyze the results of the experiment.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you must have the following prerequisites:

* You must have completed the exercises in [Getting started: Rules and targeting](/guides/flags/rules-and-targeting). The exercises in this guide rely on concepts from that guide.
* An active LaunchDarkly account with the ability to create a flag.
* "Do not track" must be disabled in your browser for the experiment's `click` events to work. To confirm that "Do not track" is disabled, visit [AllAboutDNT.com](https://allaboutdnt.com).
* You should be familiar with the concept of experimentation for software products, and know what results you want to determine.
* You must have Experimentation enabled in your LaunchDarkly account. To enable Experimentation, contact your LaunchDarkly account manager or email sales@launchdarkly.com.
* Access to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/about). To learn more, read [How to use Glitch](https://glitch.com/create).

## Concepts

The following concepts will help you understand this guide.

### Multivariate flags

A multivariate flag is a feature flag that is not boolean and has more than one possible variation. Multivariate flags allow you to use one flag to serve multiple variations of a feature simultaneously. To learn more, read [Understanding multivariate flags](/home/flags/variations#understanding-multivariate-flags).

## Setting up the app

This app builds on the same app we use in the [Getting started: Rules and targeting](/guides/flags/rules-and-targeting) guide. If you haven't completed that guide yet, read and complete those exercises first and then return to this guide.

The app below begins where the previous guide left off:

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;margin-bottom:24px">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/starlight-travel-4?path=README.md&previewSize=0&attributionHidden=true"
    title="Starlight Travel by LaunchDarkly on Glitch"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;"
  ></iframe>
</div>

To begin, remix the Glitch project to create an editable copy of the app. Use the embedded Glitch app above, or [click here to remix the app](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/starlight-travel-4).

## Setting up the LaunchDarkly project and environment

The LaunchDarkly Python SDK and client-side JavaScript SDK are installed in this app already. You must add your project's SDK key, which you'll do in the next section.

You can reuse the project and environment you created in [Getting started: Configuring an SDK and creating a flag](/guides/flags/sdk-flag), or create a new one.

Here is an image of where to find your SDK keys:

![The Project page in LaunchDarkly with environment SDK keys called out.](starlight-travel-projects.png)

### Configuring the SDK key and client ID

Glitch lets you store environment variables, such as secrets or config variables, that your app can read from memory. This is a more secure practice than hard-coding these directly into your code.

Here is an image of a sample .env file:

![An .env file.](dot-env-experimentation.png)

To configure the SDK key and client ID:

1. Find a file called `.env` in the Glitch sidebar.
2. Copy the **SDK key** from the **Test** environment by clicking on the key.
3. Assign the **SDK key** to the environment variable called `LD_SDK_KEY`.
4. Copy the **Client-side ID** from the **Test** environment.
5. Assign the **Client-side ID** to the environment variable called `LD_CLIENT_SIDE_ID`:

<CodeTabs defaultValue="env" values={[{ label: '.env', value: 'env', }]}>
  <CodeTabItem value="env">

```env
LD_SDK_KEY=<your-SDK-key>
LD_CLIENT_SIDE_ID=<your-client-side-id>
```

  </CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Creating a multivariate flag

Experiments can use boolean flags for A/B tests, or multivariate flags for A/B/n tests. Multivariate flags have multiple settings that let you define different variations of one feature. This exercise uses a multivariate flag.

Experiments use multivariate flags to test different versions of a feature. Settings can include strings, numbers, or JSON.

This exercise tests different prices to determine at what price students are more willing to purchase a trip. The trips are discounted to 25%, 50%, and 75% off their original price.

A 25% discount means a student would pay 75% of the original cost of the trip. The equation to calculate this for a $100 trip is `100 * .75`. Similarly, to calculate a 50% discount for a $100 trip, enter `100 * .5`

The application stores numbers like this in an array. You will use a multivariate flag's value to calculate the discount. To do this, multiply the values in the array by a constant .25 for 75% off, .5 for 50% off, and .75 for 25% off.

Each of those values corresponds to one variation of a feature flag. When you run an experiment, you compare how each variation of a flag produces different behavior in your users.

To create a new flag:

1. From the flag dashboard, click **Create flag**.
2. Name your flag "Student Discount Pricing."
3. (Optional) Enter a description of the flag to help account members understand what the flag is for.
4. Click into the **Tags** menu and enter `experiment`. This creates a tag that lets you filter flags based on which flags have experiments running.
5. Check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox.
6. In the **Flag variations** menu choose "Number."
7. Enter a name and value for the variations as given below:

- Variation 1 value: `.25`
- Variation 1 name: 75% off
- Variation 2 value: `.5`
- Variation 2 name: 50% off
- Variation 3 value: `.75`
- Variation 3 name: 25% off
- Variation 4 value: `1`
- Variation 4 name: No discount

![The "Create a feature flag" panel for the "Student Discount Pricing" flag.](starlight-travel-student-discount-flag.png)

9. Click **Save flag**.

### Targeting users

An experiment requires two or more populations to test against.

Here are some possible ways to divide your experiment population:

- Logged in as opposed to anonymous
- By company
- By geography
- Randomly

In this experiment, you target users based on their email address. You want to offer pricing discounts based on whether a person is a student. Users with a `.edu` email address are presented with three different prices.

To target users with a `.edu` email address:

1. Navigate to the **Targeting** tab for your new flag.
2. In the "Target users who match these rules" section, click **Add rules**.
3. In the **Select an attribute** menu choose `email`.
4. In the **Select an operator** menu choose `ends with`.
5. In the **Enter some values** field enter `.edu`.
6. In the last menu choose "a percentage rollout."
7. Enter percentage values for the four variations of your flag. The values must add up to 100%:

![A flag's targeting rules configuration.](starlight-travel-targeting-rules.png)

8. Toggle flag targeting **On**.
9. Click **Review and save**.

### Creating a click metric

Metrics let you measure user behaviors affected by a flag. The three types of metrics are click, page view, and custom metrics.

To learn more about metrics, read [Creating metrics](/home/creating-experiments/metrics).

First, copy the URL for your Glitch app. To find it:

1. From the Glitch console, click the **Share** button. A pop-up with a URL appears.
2. Copy the **Live site** URL.
3. Save the URL somewhere where it is easy to access.

![The Share project pop-up in Glitch.](starlight-travel-share-project.png)

Next, create a click metric to track the discount which results in the highest number of packages purchased:

1. In LaunchDarkly, navigate to the **Experiments** page.
2. Click the **Metrics** tab.
3. Click **Create metric**. The "Create a new metric" panel appears.
4. Name your metric "Student pricing tier".
5. Enter a **Description** to indicate what the metric is tracking, such as "Track price chosen by students."
6. Choose "Click" from the **Event kind** menu.
7. Enter `a.btn` in the **Click targets** field.
8. In the **Target URL** menu, choose "Substring Match".
9. Paste in the URL for your Glitch app, which you found and saved in the previous procedure:

![The "Create a new metric" screen.](starlight-travel-create-new-metric.png)

### Adding the flag's code to the application

Next, update your app to display discounted pricing if a user logs in with a `.edu` email address.

To update your app:

1. Navigate to your Glitch app.
2. Find the `server.py` file in the sidebar and click to open it.
3. Replace the pricing array line `price = np.array([10000, 25000, 100000])` with the following:

<CodeTabs defaultValue="py" values={[{ label: 'Multivariate flag with discount', value: 'py', }]}>
  <CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
discount = ld_client.variation('student-discount-pricing', user, 1)
price = np.array([10000, 25000, 100000]) * discount
```

  </CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Validating the flag's behavior

Before going on to set up your experiment, confirm the multivariate flag and targeting rules work.

To confirm the rules work:

1. From the Glitch editing window, click **View app**. The Starlight Travel app appears.
2. Click **Log in**:

![Starlight Travel app login.](starlight-travel-login.png)

3. Enter a random email address ending in `.edu`.
4. Click **Log in**.
5. A discounted price appears for all tiers.
6. Click your avatar in the upper right and select "Log out".
7. Log in again with a random email ending in `.com`.
8. Standard pricing appears.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Disable "Do not track"</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you have enabled "Do not track," you will not be able to log in to the Glitch app. If you disable "Do not track" but the login still fails, try disabling ad blockers or popup blockers in your browser as well.

## Building the experiment

To build your experiment:

1. In LaunchDarkly, navigate to the **Experiments** page.
2. Click **Create experiment**.
3. Enter an **Experiment name**.
4. Enter a **Hypothesis** for your experiment, such as "Students receiving a 75% discount will buy more items more often than those receiving a lower or no discount," and click **Next**. The "Select metrics" step opens.
5. Choose "Student pricing tier" from the **Primary metric** menu and click **Next**. The "Define variations" step opens.
6. Choose the "Student Discount Pricing" flag from the **Select flag** menu and click **Next**. The "Set audience" step opens.
7. Assign 25% of your audience to each of the four flag variations.
8. In the **Control** menu, select "No discount."
9. Click **Finish**. You are returned to the experiment's **Design** tab.

### Starting the experiment

To start a new iteration of your experiment, click **Start** at the top of the **Design** tab:

![The "Design" tab of an experiment with the "Start" button called out.](starlight-experiment-start.png)

### Simulating traffic

For this exercise, you will simulate traffic to your application. To do this:

1. From the Glitch console, click the **Share** button. A pop-up with a URL appears.
2. Copy the **Live site** URL and enter it into a new browser window.
3. Generate traffic by pressing `!` several times.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>You may have to wait for Experimentation results</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Data can take up to ten minutes to appear in LaunchDarkly after your experiment starts.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

When you press `!`, 100 `.com` email addresses and 100 `.edu` email addresses try to access your app. None of the `.com` email addresses will receive a reduced price. The `.edu` addresses will randomly receive discounted prices. This information is reflected in the experiment's results.

## Interpreting experiment results

When you start your experiment, LaunchDarkly begins collecting data. The winning variation for an experiment is the variation that has the highest "probability to be best," meaning it is most likely to be the best option out of all of the variations you tested. You can find the variation with the highest probability to be best in the experiment's "Primary metric results" table on the **Results** tab.

To learn more, read [Winning variations](/home/analyzing-experiments/winning-variation).

### Reading experiment data

The data your experiment collected is represented in a results table:

![The "Student pricing tier" experiment's results.](experiment-results.png)

In this example, the `25% off` variation has the highest probability to be best.

To learn more about reading an experiment's results table, read [Reading experiment data](/home/analyzing-experiments#reading-experiment-data).
