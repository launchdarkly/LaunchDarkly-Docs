## Overview

This guide explains best practices for managing custom roles and how to use a single-sign-on (SSO) provider for cross-domain identity management (SCIM) provisioning.

You can enforce permissions or restrictions regarding projects, environments, and other resources using custom roles. After you configure them, you can manage custom roles with your SSO administration rather than in the LaunchDarkly application.

This guide covers:
- [Recreating built-in roles in LaunchDarkly](#recreating-built-in-roles)
- [Creating your own custom roles](#creating-custom-roles)
- [Mapping your current custom roles](#mapping-roles)
- [Using teams to manage permissions](#using-launchdarkly-teams-to-manage-permissions)
- [Using custom roles with specific IdPs](#using-custom-roles-with-your-idp)

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you must have the following prerequisites:

- An owner / admin role in your LaunchDarkly account, or a custom role with [team management permissions](/home/members/role-actions#team-actions).
- A basic understanding of custom roles within LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).
- Access to the SSO and SCIM configuration at your organization and the Identity Provider (IdP) you use. To learn more, read [Single sign-on](/home/account-security/sso).

## Concepts

You should understand these concepts before reading this guide:

### Members

Account members are people who work at your organization or have access rights to your organization's LaunchDarkly environment for another reason, such as contractors or part-time employees.

To learn more about members, read [LaunchDarkly account members](/home/members/managing).

### Teams

Teams are groups of your organization's members. A LaunchDarkly account administrator can give specific permissions to teams with custom roles that let them perform actions on different resources, such as projects or flags.

To learn more about teams, read [Teams](/home/teams).

### LaunchDarkly's built-in roles

Every LaunchDarkly account has three built-in roles: `reader`, `writer`, and `owner / admin`. Customers on an Enterprise plan also have a restricted `no access` role. Every account member must have at least either one of these built-in roles or a custom role. If you need to, you can also assign account members multiple custom roles to give them the exact set of permissions they need.

To learn more about built-in roles, read [LaunchDarkly’s built-in roles](/home/members/built-in-roles).

### Custom roles

Custom roles enable organizations to define granular permissions of actions that a user is allowed to perform or blocked from performing in LaunchDarkly.

Many organizations prefer to use custom roles instead of LaunchDarkly's built-in roles to access this additional flexibility when they configure SSO or SCIM.

To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

### Policies

A policy in LaunchDarkly is a set of actions a role can or cannot take. Each policy is a list of statements allowing or denying a user access to resources and actions within LaunchDarkly.

Policies can be direct or inverse. A direct policy allows or denies access to the resource defined. An inverse policy allows or denies actions for all resources except the one listed. 

<Details summary="Expand direct policy example">

This policy denies all actions within the production environment:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Direct policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "deny",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/production:flag/*"]
  }
]
  ```

  </CodeTabItem>
  </CodeTabs>
  
  </Details>
  
<Details summary="Expand inverse policy example">

This policy allows all actions across all environments except production:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Inverse policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "notResources": ["proj/*:env/production:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

</Details>

To learn more about policies, read [Using policies](/home/members/role-policies).

### Identity provider

An identity provider (IdP) is a service that creates, maintains, and manages users’ digital identities and permissions to use applications and services. It functions as a directory, sharing credentials with digital services and devices. IdPs communicate over Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or Open Authorization (OAuth).

To learn more about IdP configuration, read [Configuring an External IdP](/home/account-security/sso#configuring-an-external-idp).

### Single sign-on

Single sign-on allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials. SSO can be deployed with an IdP to manage credentials and authentication to applications.

### SCIM

SCIM is a standard for automating the exchange of information between identity domains, or IT systems.

The SSO workflow within LaunchDarkly creates a new user if they sign in with the IdP and can pass a role. SCIM allows you to pass a role when creating and managing users as an admin.

To learn more about SCIM, read [User provisioning with SCIM](/home/account-security/sso#user-provisioning-with-scim).

## Recreating built-in roles

When you are ready to configure custom roles for your organization, start by recreating LaunchDarkly's built-in roles. Recreating built-in roles is useful because you can then build upon them to create similar, but personalized, custom roles. For example, you may want to create a role that gives a member `writer` access to one project, but `reader` access to all remaining projects.

This table displays the built-in roles and their associated permissions that you will recreate in this guide:

</Details>

These policies can now be used as a starting point to create more custom roles, such as users who have write-access to only specific projects.

## Creating custom roles

Now that you have LaunchDarkly's built-in roles recreated, you can use them as a foundation to build custom roles to suit your needs.

As a default state, a blank custom role denies all access to all resources. You must explicitly grant access to a resource for a member to view or edit it.

For some actions, access must be granted across all environments to function properly. These actions include:

- `createFlag`
- `deleteFlag`
- `updateIncludeInSnippet`
- `updateName`
- `updateDescription`
- `updateTemporary`
- `updateTags`
- `updateMaintainer`
- `updateFlagVariations`
- `updateFlagCustomProperties`

To learn more, read [Using actions](/home/members/role-actions).

Expand each of the sections below to learn how to build example custom roles using the advanced editor.

<Details summary="Expand tag-specific permissions custom role">

### Tag-specific permissions

One way to organize access to resources is by tagging individual resources, and then creating custom roles with access based on tags. For example, you can create a `dev` tag for your environments and use it in a policy to allow access only to development environments. Tags can be added to projects, environments, segments, flags, and metrics.

Here is the code sample to build a custom role with access resources with a `dev` tag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dev-tagged resources', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/*;dev"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*;dev"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*;dev"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Anyone with this custom role can edit resources with a `dev` tag. This role is useful for a developer or quality assurance (QA) role if you tag your non-production environments with `dev`.

</Details>

<Details summary="Expand project-specific permissions with view access custom role">

### Project-specific permissions with view access

In this example, you will create a "New checkout flow" custom role that has edit permissions in the `New-checkout-flow` project only, and can view all other projects.

Here is the code sample:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'New checkout flow project', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/New-checkout-flow:env/*"]
  }
]
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Anyone with this custom role can edit all resources within the `New-checkout-flow` project, and view all other projects. This role is useful for developers or project managers working only on specific projects, but who need visibility into other projects at your organization.

</Details>

<Details summary="Expand project-specific permissions without view access custom role">

### Project-specific permissions without view access

In this example, you will create a "New checkout flow" custom role that has edit permissions in the `New-checkout-flow` project only, but cannot view any other projects.

Here is the code sample:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'New checkout flow project', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "deny",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "notResources": ["proj/New-checkout-flow"]
  },
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/New-checkout-flow"]
  }
]
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Anyone with this custom role can edit all resources within the `New-checkout-flow` project, but view no other projects. This role is useful for developers working only on specific projects who don't need visibility into other projects at your organization.

</Details>

For more custom role examples, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).

## Mapping roles

Now that you know how to create your own custom roles, you can begin thinking about your organization's specific needs. Scoping the different roles, teams, and permissions your organization uses will help you create a policy structure that’s scalable and easy to implement.

Some questions to consider include:

- How are units at your organization structured?
- Do you use LaunchDarkly's [teams feature](#using-launchdarkly-teams-to-manage-permissions)?
- Who do you want to target with custom roles?
- Do you have separate QA, Dev, and Production units?
- What level of access do you need for Engineering leads, QA, support, etc.?
- What environments do you use within each project?
- Do projects change frequently or do they last indefinitely?
- Do you need separate roles for permissions at the project level and at the environment level?
- Do you have an internal approval process for enabling flags in Production?
- Do external organizations ever toggle flags?
- Who will be responsible for maintenance and future access control?

Here is an example of a role map for an organization:

Account members can have more than one custom role. This is useful if one person performs multiple roles. For example, if an engineer is also a tech lead on only certain projects, you may want to assign them both a "Tech lead" role and a "Developer/QA" role. Assigning multiple roles can make it easier to add and remove sets of permissions as an account member's duties change.

If two custom roles have conflicting permission levels, the more permissive level of access is applied. For example, if a member has one custom role that allows access to a resource, and another custom role that denies access to that resource, the member is granted access.

If you don't want to worry about conflicting permissions within multiple custom roles, you may want to create additional custom roles, such as a "Tech lead + QA" role, that includes access needed for both. This eliminates the complexity of managing multiple roles per member, but requires that you create more custom roles up front to cover all of the possible role combinations.

## Using LaunchDarkly teams to manage permissions

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Teams is an Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Teams is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Teams help large organizations to more easily manage their members and access in LaunchDarkly. Instead of assigning custom roles to individual members, you can assign a custom role to a team, then add members to the team. If you update or add permissions to the team, all the team members inherit those permissions automatically. To learn how to add custom roles to a team, read [Managing team permissions](/home/teams/managing#managing-team-permissions).

Removing members from the team revokes any permissions the team granted to them. To learn how to add or remove members from a team, read [Managing team members](/home/teams/managing#managing-team-members). 

To learn more about best practices when using teams, read [Building teams in LaunchDarkly](/guides/best-practices/teams).

## Using custom roles with your IdP

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Using SCIM to provision users</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you use SCIM to provision users, you will create the roles in LaunchDarkly, but you must configure and manage your account members in the IdP. To learn more, read [User provisioning with scim](/home/account-security/sso#user-provisioning-with-scim).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

With your custom roles designed and built, you can now manage them using SSO and your IdP.

When you pass account member information into LaunchDarkly from your IdP, you  must include the key of the member's custom role in a `customRole` attribute, along with their other profile information such as name and email address. To learn more about the `customRole` attribute, read [Custom attributes](/home/account-security/sso#custom-attributes).

The fields and methods you must use to pass custom role information to LaunchDarkly differ depending on your IdP. We provide configuration guidance for the following IdPs:

- ADFS
- Azure
- GSuite
- Okta
- OneLogin

You can map LaunchDarkly custom role attributes to ADFS using a Claim issuance Policy. To learn how, read [Configuring custom roles](/home/account-security/adfs#configuring-custom-roles).

After your policy is set up, you can assign members to custom role groups using the **Member of** tab within the ADFS user properties window.
