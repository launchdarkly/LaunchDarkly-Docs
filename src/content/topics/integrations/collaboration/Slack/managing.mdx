## Overview

This topic explains how to view and filter flags and resources with the LaunchDarkly Slack app.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>You must invite the LaunchDarkly Slack app to private Slack channels</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you want to subscribe to notifications in private channels, you must invite the LaunchDarkly bot `@LaunchDarkly` to the channel. If the LaunchDarkly Slack bot is not in a channel, it cannot send notifications to that channel.

You do not need to manually invite the LaunchDarkly bot user to public channels.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can subscribe to updates from specific flags or add a flag filter to receive notifications only from certain flags within a channel. To learn how, read [Adding flag filters to a channel](/integrations/slack/notifications#adding-flag-filters-to-a-channel).

## Filtering for resources with in-line commands

You can use in-line commands to filter for flags and resources in Slack. All in-line commands start with `/launchdarkly` and typing `/launchdarkly` or `/ld` will bring up a help menu listing the commands.

To filter with in-line commands:

1. Type `/launchdarkly subscribe` but append filtering criteria.
2. Specify the filtering criteria with either a single dash (`-`) and the first letter of the criteria, or a double dash (`--`) and the criteria name and an equal sign.
3. Press **Enter.** The results of the filter display.
4. Subscribe to any flags by selecting "Add flag to channel" from the dropdown.
5. Subscribe to all the resources from this Filter by clicking **Add filter to channel**.

Examples of both types of entries:

- `-e` or `--environment=`
- `-p` or `--project=`
- `-t` or `--tag=`
- `-s` or `--status=`
- `-f` or `--flag_key=`
- `-a` or `--action=`

`/launchdarkly subscribe -p mobile -e test -s active` retrieves the same results as `/launchdarkly subscribe --project=mobile --environment=test --status=active`

## Viewing feature flag information

You can view more detail about any flag using the flag overview message. The flag overview message is available from the list of filtered flags and any flag update notification by clicking **View details**.

You can use the flag overview message to interact with the flag and access it on the LaunchDarkly website.

Here are some things you can do from the Flag Overview message:

- Click the flag's name to be taken to the flag's **Targeting** tab within the LaunchDarkly app.
- Toggle the flag on or off by clicking the overflow menu and selecting **Toggle targeting**. If you change the flag's state to on or off, a flag update notification appears in the Slack channel.
- Subscribe to updates about the flag in the channel. To learn how, read [Subscribing to flag notifications](/integrations/slack/notifications#subscribing-to-flag-notifications).

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Remember your cases!</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

The data you specify for the in-line commands are case sensitive. If a filter you specify manually does not return
any results, verify that you used the correct cases. For example, if you type `my-project` when the actual name of
the project is `My-Project`, the filter does not return any results.

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Filter results

When you filter resources, the results appear in a Slack dialog. Flags and resources matching the filter criteria appear in this dialog.

![An example set of filtered flags.](slack-flag-filtered-list.png)

At the bottom of the filter results, there are three buttons:

- **Next** takes you to another page of filter results, if available.
- **Add filter to Channel** adds the filter criteria to channel. This automatically adds resources that match filter criteria to the channel, and you'll get a notification every time the status of one of the matching flags, segments, metrics, environments, or projects changes.
- **Adjust Filter** opens the Filter Flags screen where you can adjust the filtering criteria.

## Listing flags in a channel

When a flag is subscribed to a channel, any updates automatically send notifications to that channel.

Use `/launchdarkly flags` to view and manage flags associated with the current channel.

## Listing filters in a channel

When a filter is applied to the channel, any sets of flags, segments, metrics, environments, and projects that match the filter criteria automatically send notifications to that channel.

Use `/launchdarkly filters` to view and manage filters associated with the current channel.

For more information about associating filters with channels, read [Filter Flag Results](#filter-results)

![The filters configured for the channel.](slack-channel-filters.png)

This menu displays the values that define the filter, including Status, Project, Environment, and Tag. If you make changes to the filter, including removing it, the channel receives a notification about the changes.
