## Requesting approval for flag changes in ServiceNow

To request approval for flag changes in ServiceNow, you must request approval for the change in LaunchDarkly and then view it in ServiceNow.

To request approval in LaunchDarkly:

1. In LaunchDarkly, navigate to the feature flag that you wish to change and make your needed changes to the flag targeting or status.
2. Click the **dropdown icon** in the **Review and save** button.
3. Select **Request Approval**. A dialog appears.
4. Enter the description and any scheduling details, if desired.
5. Click **Request Approval**. This creates a change request with state "New" in your ServiceNow instance.

To access the change request in ServiceNow:

1. In LaunchDarkly, click the **checkmark** on the right side of the flag **Targeting** tab.
2. Click **View** on the request, then select "Review in ServiceNow" from the expanded approval request page view.

3. The approvers for feature flag changes receive a notification.

When your ServiceNow approval conditions are met and the change request has been moved into the "Implemented" state, you may apply the flag changes within LaunchDarkly by clicking the **Apply Changes** button in the pending changes panel. Your ServiceNow change request state changes to "Review."

If your change request changes to "Canceled," LaunchDarkly assumes the approval request has been denied. Similarly, if the approval request is deleted in LaunchDarkly, the ServiceNow change request state changes to "Canceled."
