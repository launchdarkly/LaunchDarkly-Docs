## Overview

This topic explains how to configure and use the ServiceNow approvals integration for use with LaunchDarkly's approval workflows. To learn more, read [Approvals](/home/managing-flags/feature-workflows/approvals).

The ServiceNow approvals integration helps your team comply with company-wide change management policies by embedding LaunchDarkly approvals into ServiceNow workflow. It bridges LaunchDarkly approval requests with ServiceNow change management workflows.

When you enable this integration, all approval requests created in a LaunchDarkly environment generate corresponding ServiceNow standard change requests. These requests populate with relevant information about the proposed change. LaunchDarkly uses the state of the corresponding standard change request to determine if the proposed change should be acknowledged as "approved" or "declined."
