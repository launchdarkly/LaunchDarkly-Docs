## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly IntelliJ plugin to interact with feature flags from within IntelliJ integrated development environments (IDEs).

A full compatibility list is available on the [JetBrains Marketplace's plugin listing](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15159-launchdarkly).

With the extension, you can:

- View a tooltip with feature flag details when you hover over a flag key in your source code

![IntelliJ hover.](intellij-hover.png)

- Open to specific feature flags in LaunchDarkly from your code editor

![The treeview right click options.](intellij-treeview-right-click.png)

- View a list of feature flags and their settings in the LaunchDarkly tool window
- Update a flag's state, fallback value, and off variation

## Prerequisites

In order to install this plugin, you must have the following prerequisites:

* **The `beta` Custom Release Channel.** Add the `beta` [Custom Release Channel](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/custom-release-channels.html) to your editor. This allows it to access a beta plugin.

* **A LaunchDarkly API access token.** To learn more about creating tokens, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).

 The access token must have sufficient permissions to support the plugin's functionality. Below is an example policy for those permissions.

 This policy allows `reader` access to all projects and `writer` access to the minimum set of fields the plugin is able to update:

 <CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example inline policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
 }>

 <CodeTabItem value="json">

 ```json
 [
   {
     "resources": ["proj/*"],
     "actions": ["viewProject"],
     "effect": "allow"
   },
   {
     "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/*"],
     "actions": ["updateOn",  "updateFallthrough", "updateOffVariation"],
     "effect": "allow"
   }
 ]
 ```

 </CodeTabItem>
 </CodeTabs>

## Installing the IntelliJ plugin

Here's how to install the IntelliJ plugin:

1. Pass in the plugin ID `15159` as part of the release channel. This ensures that only the LaunchDarkly Beta plugin is added to your available list.
2. Add this URL to **Manage Plugin Repositories**: `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/beta/15159`
3. After you configure the plugin, you can install LaunchDarkly from the list of available plugins or from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15159-launchdarkly).

## Configuring the IntelliJ plugin

After you install the LaunchDarkly extension, a `LaunchDarkly Plugin` menu option appears.

![IntelliJ Configuration](intellij-configuration.png)

1. Grant IntelliJ access to system's default credential store. This is to securely store your access token with [IntelliJ's Credential Store API](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/persisting-sensitive-data.html).
2. Provide a LaunchDarkly **API access token**.
3. Click **Apply**. This queries the LaunchDarkly API for a list of projects and environments.
4. Select your **LaunchDarkly project**.
5. Select your **LaunchDarkly environment**.
6. Click **OK**.

After you complete this procedure, you have configured the plugin.

If you only want to configure it for a specific IntelliJ Project, there is a sub-menu `Project Overrides` that only configures the plugin for the current project loaded.

## Code references in the IntelliJ plugin

The LaunchDarkly IntelliJ plugin supports code references. Configuring aliases for projects with code references makes the informational hover card available wherever that alias is used. To learn more, read [Finding flag aliases](/home/code/code-references#finding-flag-aliases).
