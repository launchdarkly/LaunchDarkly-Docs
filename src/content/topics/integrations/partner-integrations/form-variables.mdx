## Overview

This topic explains how to use form variables to collect configuration data from members when they begin using your integration. Most integrations need to collect one or more pieces of configuration data that support the integration, such as API tokens or webhook endpoints.

## Building form variables

To support your configuration, you must describe a set of `formVariables` that define your  configuration properties. The `formVariables` populate a form in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI) that members complete to add your integration.

Here's an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example manifest', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
"formVariables": [
    {
        "key": "endpointUrl",
        "name": "Webhook endpoint URL",
        "description": "Enter the URL to the webhook endpoint",
        "defaultValue": "https://example.com/inbound_webhook",
        "type": "url"
    },
    {
        "key": "apiToken",
        "name": "API Key",
        "description": "Enter your [API key](https://example.com/api) here",
        "type": "string",
        "isSecret": true
    }
]
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Here's how the `formVariables` entry above displays on the [LaunchDarkly Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations):

Form variables apply to the entire integration configuration. There are no capability-specific form variables.

Here are the form variables you need to supply:
- `key`, `name`, `description`, and `type` are required.
- `formVariables[].description` is used as a field label on the UI. You can use simple Markdown to link a word or phrase to an external URL.
- Optionally, you can set `isSecret` or `isOptional` if necessary, or provide guidance with `placeholder` and `defaultValue`. If you provide a `defaultValue`, you must also set `isOptional` to `true` and vice versa.

Accepted form variable `type`s are `string`, `boolean`, `uri`, `enum`, and `dynamicEnum`.
