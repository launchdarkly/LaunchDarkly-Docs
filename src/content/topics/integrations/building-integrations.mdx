## Overview

This topic explains the LaunchDarkly integration framework and how it relates to our partner program.

In addition to giving you control over deployments and rollouts, feature flags can provide context to third-party tools that show you how your application reacts to flag changes. You can integrate these tools with LaunchDarkly using the LaunchDarkly integration framework.

After review by our integrations team, you can also choose to add your integration to our publicly available integrations list. You can find the full list of LaunchDarkly integrations in our [integration repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/tree/main/integrations).

## About the integration framework

LaunchDarkly's integration framework lets you use a standard configuration to build one-way integrations from LaunchDarkly to third-party services.

We welcome participation from anyone who is interested in building integrations that work with LaunchDarkly:

- Developers can build using our framework and open up new integrations for use by their teams. To learn how, read [Building your own integrations](#building-your-own-integrations).
- Technology Partners can build using our framework and list their integration with us. To learn how to become a partner, read about our [Building publicly available integrations](#building-publicly-available-integrations).

## Building your own integrations

LaunchDarkly supports a subset of actions that let you subscribe to LaunchDarkly events to trigger an action or event in your service. This capability is similar to a webhook, with the added convenience of not having to write your own service to manage the integration. LaunchDarkly manages the configuration, authentication, and transformation of our events to what your service expects without having to create an intermediary service. We provide step-by-step instructions to help you build integrations in our [LaunchDarkly Integration Framework repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework).

## Understanding integration capabilities

Your integration's capabilities describe how it interacts with LaunchDarkly. 

LaunchDarkly supports the following integration capabilities:

- Audit log events hook
- Triggers
- Reserved custom properties
- Feature store

### Audit log events hook

An audit log events hook is a webhook that LaunchDarkly sends whenever an event happens inside of LaunchDarkly. Each of these events result in an event being published to LaunchDarkly's audit log. You can use this capability to send data to or trigger an event in another service.

To learn more, read [Audit log events hook](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/main/docs/capabilities.md#audit-log-events-hook-auditlogeventshook).

### Triggers

Flag triggers is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

You can use the trigger capability to generate a unique webhook URL that your service can request to generate a user-defined flag change in LaunchDarkly. To learn more, read [Trigger](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/main/docs/capabilities.md#trigger-trigger).

### Reserved custom properties

You can use custom properties to store data in LaunchDarkly alongside a feature flag. For example, you can use custom properties to indicate flag-level associations with data on your service. If you don't have any flag-level associations or configurations, you don't need to use this capability.

To learn more, read [Custom properties](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/main/docs/capabilities.md#reserved-custom-properties-reservedcustomproperties).

### Feature store

The feature store capability allows LaunchDarkly to write feature flag data to a given provider. To view the schema for feature stores, read [Feature store](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/blob/332ce1e6b58154f523a5bd7de8c7cd790c3bd4a4/schemas/capabilities/featureStore.json).

## Using OAuth

You can authorize your application to communicate with LaunchDarkly using OAuth. OAuth also lets you limit the connection of your integrated app to individual members. To learn how, read [OAuth applications](/home/connecting/oauth).

## Using the LaunchDarkly REST API

You can use the LaunchDarkly REST API to interact with LaunchDarkly in many of the same ways that you can through the user interface (UI). To learn how, read our [API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/).

## Building publicly available integrations

In addition to using the integration framework, you can join our Technology Partner Program to make your integrations publicly available. The Technology Partner Program empowers technology partners to build, launch, and go-to-market with LaunchDarkly. Benefits include partnership support, early product access, and joint marketing opportunities, among others. To learn more or to join the program, visit our [Partners page](https://launchdarkly.com/partners/).
