## Overview

This topic explains how to set up and configure the Gitlab CI to use with LaunchDarkly.

You can use the [`ld-find-code-refs`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/) utility with [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/) to automatically populate code references in LaunchDarkly.

Follow the procedure below to create a GitLab CI configuration using LaunchDarkly's code references executable.

## Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

- An API access token with `writer` permissions. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).

## Setting up GitLab CI

Here's how to set up the GitLab CI:

1. Navigate to your GitLab project's CI / CD settings by clicking through **Your project** > **Settings** > **CI/CD**.
2. Expand **Variables**.
3. Create a variable called `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Use the same value as your LaunchDarkly access token. Click the toggle to set the variable to **Masked**.
4. Create a variable called `LD_PROJECT_KEY`. Use your LaunchDarkly project's key as the value. Find the project key in **Account Settings > Projects**. 

To learn more about setting variables, read [GitLab's documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#creating-a-custom-environment-variable).

5. Open your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This file defines your project's CI/CD pipeline. To learn more about getting started with GitLab CI, read [GitLab's documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/#getting-started).
6. Copy and paste the following into `.gitlab-ci.yml`. No changes to the script are needed if your pipeline runs on Alpine Linux. If `apk` is unavailable in your environment then you'll need to modify the first three steps to use a different package manager.

  script:
    - ld-find-code-refs
       --accessToken $LD_ACCESS_TOKEN
       --projKey $LD_PROJECT_KEY
       --dir $CI_PROJECT_DIR
       --repoName $CI_PROJECT_NAME
       --repoUrl $CI_PROJECT_URL
       --branch $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
       --updateSequenceId $CI_PIPELINE_IID
       --commitUrlTemplate https://gitlab.com/${CI_PROJECT_PATH}/commit/"\${sha}"
       --hunkUrlTemplate https://gitlab.com/${CI_PROJECT_PATH}/blob/"\${sha}/\${filePath}#L\${lineNumber}"
```

## How the script works

When executed, this script downloads and runs the `ld-find-code-refs` docker image.

This script runs the docker image with previously-set variables, as well as GitLab-specific configurations.

The `find-launchdarkly-code-refs` script runs in GitLab's `deploy` phase. As written, `find-launchdarkly-code-refs` runs concurrent to other scripts in the `deploy` stage. We positioned the script this way so problems running `ld-find-code-refs` won't block the deployment pipeline.

In the example `.gitlab-ci.yml` below, the `find-launchdarkly-code-refs` script runs as a part of a project's pipeline.

 values={[
   { label: 'YAML', value: 'yaml', },
 ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
image: alpine:latest

build1:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Build something"

test1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Test something"

deploy1:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy something"

find-launchdarkly-code-refs:
  stage: deploy
  image:
    name: launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs:2.0.0
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    - ld-find-code-refs
       --accessToken $LD_ACCESS_TOKEN
       --projKey $LD_PROJECT_KEY
       --dir $CI_PROJECT_DIR
       --repoName $CI_PROJECT_NAME
       --repoUrl $CI_PROJECT_URL
       --branch $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
       --updateSequenceId $CI_PIPELINE_IID
       --commitUrlTemplate https://gitlab.com/${CI_PROJECT_PATH}/commit/"\${sha}"
       --hunkUrlTemplate https://gitlab.com/${CI_PROJECT_PATH}/blob/"\${sha}/\${filePath}#L\${lineNumber}"
```

When the jobs run in the pipeline, they display like this:

## Additional configuration options

There are more configuration options for `ld-find-code-refs`.

You can exclude files and directories from searches with an [`.ldignore`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ignoring-files-and-directories) file.

You can use the [`.launchdarkly/config.yaml`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#advanced-yaml-configuration) file for advanced configuration, such as configuring custom delimiters and aliases for your flag keys.

To learn more, read the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md).
