## Overview

This topic explains how to use the [`ld-find-code-refs`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/) utility with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically populate code references in LaunchDarkly.

## Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

- An API access token with `writer` permissions, stored as a repository secret titled `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN`. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).

## Setting up GitHub Actions

To set up:

1. Log into GitHub and navigate to your repo.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets** and click **Add a new secret**.
3. Paste in your access token to the field that appears and click **Save secret**.

4. Return to your GitHub repository to create a new Actions workflow.

- **If you already have an `action.yml` file**: Copy and paste the `launchDarklyCodeReferences` job declaration below into the jobs section in your `action.yml` file.
- **If you don't already have a workflow file:** Create a new file titled `action.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Paste the following code in the **Edit file** section:

<CodeTabs
 defaultValue="yaml"
 values={[
   { label: 'YAML', value: 'yaml', },
 ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
on: push
name: Example Workflow
jobs:
  launchDarklyCodeReferences:
    name: LaunchDarkly Code References
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 11 # This value must be set if the lookback configuration option is not disabled for find-code-references. Read more: https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs#searching-for-unused-flags-extinctions
      - name: LaunchDarkly Code References
        uses: launchdarkly/find-code-references@v9
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          accessToken: ${{ secrets.LD_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          projKey: YOUR_PROJECT_KEY
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

  <CalloutTitle>Best practices for configuring an Actions file</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

We strongly recommend that you update the second `uses` attribute value to reference the most recent tag in the
[launchdarkly/find-code-references](https://github.com/launchdarkly/find-code-references) repository. This pins your
workflow to a particular version of the `launchdarkly/find-code-references` action.

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

5. Commit this file under a new branch and submit as a PR to your code reviewers to be merged into your master branch.

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Code references are not blocked by PR approval</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    You do not need to have this branch merged into the master branch for code references to appear in the LaunchDarkly
    UI; code references will appear for this newly created branch.
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

As shown in the example above, the workflow should run on the `push` event and contain an action provided by the [launchdarkly/find-code-references](https://github.com/launchdarkly/find-code-references) repository.

Include both the `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN` as a secret and a new environment variable containing your LaunchDarkly project key. Find the project key in **Account Settings > Projects** in the LaunchDarkly dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

After you create the workflow, you can confirm that it's working correctly by creating a new pull request with the workflow file and verifying that the newly created action succeeds.

If the action fails, there may be a problem with your configuration. To investigate, review the action's logs to view any error messages.

## Additional configuration options

You can configure `ld-find-code-refs` with additional [inputs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith) to enable more functionality.

In addition to inputs, you can skip searching files and directories using a [`.ldignore`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ignoring-files-and-directories) file.

You can also use the [`.launchdarkly/config.yaml`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#advanced-yaml-configuration) file for advanced configuration options, such as configuring custom delimiters and aliases for your flag keys.
