This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's trigger feature with SignalFx. For example, you can create an alert in SignalFx that toggles a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this topic, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* You must have a feature flag with a trigger. To learn more about creating triggers, read [Creating a new flag trigger](/integrations/triggers#creating-a-new-flag-trigger).
* You must have access to the trigger's URL. To learn more about accessing trigger URLs, read [Understanding flag triggers' security](/integrations/triggers#understanding-flag-triggers-security).
* You must have an existing [SignalFx](https://www.signalfx.com/) account. 

## Connecting a flag trigger to SignalFx

Connecting a LaunchDarkly trigger to SignalFx takes two steps. 

You must: 

1. Create a webhook in SignalFx with your trigger URL, and
2. Connect that webhook to a SignalFx Detector.

### Setting up a webhook in SignalFx

To configure a webhook to be triggered by Detector events and changes:

1. Log in to SignalFx.
2. Go to the Integrations tab and Select the "Webhook" integration. 
3. Click on **New Integration**.
4. Enter a human-readable name in the **Name** field and paste the trigger URL into the **URL** field.
5. Click **Save**.

### Adding the webhook to a Detector as a recipient

To configure a recipient on a SignalFx Detector:

1. Create or select the Detector you want associated with the trigger in the Alerts tab. To learn more about Detectors and how to configure them, read [SignalFx's documentation](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/detect-alert/index.html).
2. From the Detector configuration popup, click on **Alert recipients**.
3. Click on **Add Recipient**, select **Webhook...** from the dropdown, and then choose the webhook you created.
4. Click **Activate Alert Rule** to activate your alert.
