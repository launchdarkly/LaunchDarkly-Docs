## Overview

This topic explains how to configure and send LaunchDarkly feature flag events to
[Chronosphere](https://chronosphere.io/). These events display as change events
within the Chronosphere Changes Explorer, and as change events on dashboards and
query results for monitors. This integration lets you visualize more of your
LaunchDarkly events within Chronosphere and have a single location for identifying
anomalies across your environment.

## Prerequisites

To configure the Chronosphere integration, you need the following information:

- **Chronosphere receiver URL**: This URL is the destination where LaunchDarkly
  sends data to Chronosphere. The URL is structured as your Chronosphere tenant
  URL, prefixed to the LaunchDarkly receiver endpoint. For example:
  `https://MY_COMPANY.chronosphere.io/api/v1/data/events/receiver/launchdarkly`.
- **Chronosphere secret token**: This credential is an API token you obtain from
  Chronosphere Support to authenticate with Chronosphere.

## Configuring the integration

To configure the Chronosphere integration:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) page and find "Chronosphere".
1. Click **Add integration**. The "Create Chronosphere configuration" panel appears.
1. (Optional) Enter a human-readable **Name**, such as **Chronosphere**.
1. In the **Chronosphere receiver URL** field, enter your Chronosphere receiver URL. For example, `https://MY_COMPANY.chronosphere.io/api/v1/data/events/receiver/launchdarkly`.
1. In the **Chronosphere secret token** field, enter the API key you obtained from Chronosphere Support.
1. (Optional) Configure a custom policy to control which information LaunchDarkly sends to Chronosphere. To learn more, see [Choosing what data to send](#choosing-what-data-to-send).
1. After reading the Integration Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.
1. Click **Save configuration**.

## Choosing what data to send

The "Policy" configuration field lets you control which kinds of LaunchDarkly events
you send to Chronosphere. The default policy value restricts it to flag changes in
production environments:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Policy example">

```txt
proj/*:env/production:flag/*
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You might want to override the default policy to restrict the integration to a
specific combination of LaunchDarkly projects and environments, or to a specific
action or set of actions.

In the following example, the policy restricts LaunchDarkly to send only changes from
the `web-app` project's production environment to Chronosphere:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Policy example">

```txt
proj/web-app:env/production:flag/*
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
