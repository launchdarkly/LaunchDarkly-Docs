## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) integration. The Splunk
integration exports LaunchDarkly audit events when a LaunchDarkly resource you
care about, such as feature flags, projects, or account members, changes. You can
use these events to create reports, charts, alerts and dashboards in Splunk.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This integration is for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud (self-service and managed)</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Based on which type of Splunk account you have, endpoint hostnames, ports, and paths may differ from what's depicted in this topic. We'll indicate these differences when they occur in the text below.

## Prerequisites

To configure the integration successfully, you must have the following
prerequisites:

* A Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC). To learn more, read [Setting up an HTTP Event Collector in Splunk Web](#setting-up-an-http-event-collector-in-splunk-web)
* An HEC token, which is generated during HEC setup.

## Setting up an HTTP Event Collector in Splunk Web

To add LaunchDarkly events to Slack, you must configure and enable Splunk's HTTP
Event Collector (HEC) in Splunk Web.

The steps to enable HEC vary based on your Splunk instance. To enable HEC, read
[Splunk's
documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector).


## Configuring LaunchDarkly to work with Splunk

To configure LaunchDarkly to start sending events to Splunk:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) and find the Splunk card.

![The Splunk integration card.](splunk-add-integration.png)

2. Click **Add integration**. The integration configuration screen appears.

![The Splunk integration configuration screen.](splunk-integration-panel.png)

3. (Optional) Give the integration a human-readable **Name**.

4. Paste the HTTP event collector URL into the **HTTP event collector base
URL**. This URL varies based on which version of Splunk you have. To learn more
about which URL format to use, read [Splunk's
documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Send_data_to_HTTP_Event_Collector).

5. Paste your HEC token in the **Token** field.

6. If you're using Splunk Cloud, you will probably need to check the **Skip certificate verification** checkbox. Splunk Cloud instances are deployed with self-signed SSL certificates which prevents LaunchDarkly's integration service from reaching Splunk Cloud's HEC
service.

7. (Optional) Configure a custom policy to control which event information LaunchDarkly sends to Splunk. To learn more about this option, read [Adding custom policies to the Splunk integration](#adding-custom-policies-to-the-splunk-integration).

8. After reading the Integration Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.

9. Click **Save configuration**.

That's it! Splunk now receives events from LaunchDarkly.

If you want to further modify the events that Splunk receives from LaunchDarkly,
add custom policies to determine which events the integration should export. If after
following these steps, you still are not able to locate LaunchDarkly events, see the
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for further guidance.

### Adding custom policies to the Splunk integration

By default, the Splunk integration sends production flag change events to
Splunk. You can customize those events with the Policy editor, using the same
language and construction as if you were creating a custom role.

To learn more, read [Custom Roles ](/home/team).

You can customize the events LaunchDarkly sends to Splunk by using the policy
editor in the Splunk configuration panel:

![The policy editor.](splunk-policy-editor.png)

## Accessing LaunchDarkly events in Splunk

Now that your integration is configured, you can see LaunchDarkly events in
Splunk.

Access those events with the following Splunk search query:

<CodeTabs defaultValue="sql" values={[{
  label: 'Splunk Query Language',
  value: 'sql',
}]}>
<CodeTabItem value="sql">

```sql
sourcetype="<NAME-OF-HTTP-EVENT-COLLECTOR>"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

![LaunchDarkly events in Splunk](launchdarkly-in-splunk.png)

After LaunchDarkly events start appearing in Splunk, you can create event
annotations in your charts in order to show LaunchDarkly events in context.

To
learn more, read [Splunk's
documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Viz/ChartEventAnnotations).

![LaunchDarkly events as annotations in Splunk
charts](ld-events-in-context-in-splunk.png)

### Troubleshooting

If you configure the LaunchDarkly integration and do not see events in Splunk, recreate the LaunchDarkly request with a `curl`.

Use this command to recreate the request:

<CodeTabs defaultValue="curl" values={[{
  label: 'curl',
  value: 'curl',
}]}>
<CodeTabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl -k \
     -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Splunk <HTTP_EVENT_COLLECTOR_TOKEN>" \
     -d '{"event": "test"}'  \
     https://<HTTP_EVENT_COLLECTOR_BASE_URL>/services/collector/event
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

* Splunk Enterprise URLs format: `<protocol>://<host>:<port>/<endpoint>`.
* Self-service Splunk Cloud URLs format: `<protocol>://input-<host>:<port>/<endpoint>`.
* Managed Splunk Cloud URLs format: `<protocol>://http-inputs-<host>:<port>/<endpoint>`.

To learn more,
[read Splunk's documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Send_data_to_HTTP_Event_Collector).

In Splunk, confirm that your **HEC Global Settings** as and your specific
HEC are set to 'Enabled' and that the **Default Index** type on your toekn is 'main'.

To search within Splunk for LaunchDarkly events using
`sourcetype="launchdarkly"`, set a custom sourcetype on your HEC token.

Set the **Source Type** as `launchdarkly`, set **Index** to `main` and set **Status** to `Enabled`.

An example token is below:
