## Overview

This topic explains how to use LaunchDarkly's trigger feature with New Relic One. For example, you can create an policy in New Relic One that uses a LaunchDarkly trigger to toggle a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this topic, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* You must have a feature flag with a trigger. To learn more about creating triggers, read [Creating a new flag trigger](/home/feature-workflows/triggers#creating-a-new-flag-trigger).
* You must have access to the trigger's URL, which you copied and saved during the trigger creation process. To learn more, read [Understanding flag triggers' security](/home/feature-workflows/triggers#understanding-flag-triggers-security).
* You must have an existing [New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com/) account.

## Connecting a flag trigger to New Relic One

Connecting a LaunchDarkly trigger to New Relic One takes two steps.

You must:

1. Create a webhook-type notification channel in New Relic One with your trigger URL, and
2. Connect that webhook to a New Relic One policy.

### Setting up a JSON template in New Relic One

First you must configure a JSON template to use the LaunchDarkly trigger.

To configure the template:

1. Log in to New Relic One.
2. Navigate to **Alerts & AI** and look for the **Notification Channels** section in the sidebar.
3. In the **Notification Channels** section, click **+ New Notification Channel**.
4. Select **Webhook** as the channel type.
5. Paste the LaunchDarkly trigger URL into the **Base URL** field.
6. Click **Create Channel**.

### Connecting the webhook to a New Relic One policy

After you create the webhook notification channel in New Relic One, you must connect it to a policy in order for the LaunchDarkly trigger to perform actions on the flag.

1. Under **Alerts & AI**, navigate to **Policies**.
2. Select the policy you wish to connect to the trigger.
3. On the policy's **Notification channels** tab, add your newly-created webhook channel.

## Testing the trigger configuration

After you create a trigger in New Relic One, you can verify that it has connected to LaunchDarkly correctly.

To test the trigger:
1. Navigate to the configuration for the webhook notification channel you set up in New Relic One.
2. Click **Send a test notification** at the bottom of the page. A popup with a response code appears.
3. Navigate back to the flag's **Settings** page in LaunchDarkly.
4. Click on the **overflow** dropdown menu on your LaunchDarkly trigger to confirm that the execution count has incremented. Sending a test notification does not trigger the flag action, so don't worry that you might toggle a flag by testing the configuration.

That's it! When the conditions of your policy are met, your flag changes will now be performed.
