## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly New Relic One integration to view LaunchDarkly events in New Relic.

LaunchDarkly integrates with New Relic One. LaunchDarkly sends feature flag change events to New Relic One as deployment events. These events appear as new deployments in the [One console's APM Event log](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/events/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users/).

## Prerequisites

To configure the integration, you must [create a REST API key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/) on your New Relic One account.

## Configuring LaunchDarkly to send flag change events to New Relic One

To configure LaunchDarkly to send events to New Relic One:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) and find "New Relic One."

2. Click **Add integration**. The "Create New Relic One configuration" panel appears.

3. Give the integration a human-readable **Name**.
4. Paste in your [**New Relic REST API key**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/).
5. Paste in your [**New Relic application ID**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/get-started/get-app-other-ids-new-relic-one/).
6. (Optional) If you have an EU Region New Relic account, select the EU option in the **Data Center** menu.
7. (Optional) Configure a custom policy to control which flag information LaunchDarkly sends to New Relic One. To learn more, read [Adding custom policies to the New Relic One integration](#adding-custom-policies-to-the-new-relic-one-integration).
8. After reading the Integration Terms and Conditions, check the **I have read and agree to the Integration Terms and Conditions** checkbox.
9. Click **Save configuration**.

### Adding custom policies to the New Relic One integration

LaunchDarkly sends all flag change events in the production environment to New Relic One by default. To customize the events LaunchDarkly sends to New Relic One, use the policy editor in the configuration panel. To learn more about creating a policy, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).

## Accessing LaunchDarkly events in New Relic One

To view LaunchDarkly events in New Relic One, navigate to your application's APM dashboard, then select the **Event log** tab on your sidebar and filter for "Deployments" link on the sidebar.

Any flag change events in your production environment (default policy) will create a new deployment event. You will be able to view the impact of that flag change within this deployment page.
