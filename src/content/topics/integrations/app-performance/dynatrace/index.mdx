## Overview

This topic explains the LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integrations available, including events and triggers.

[Dynatrace](https://dynatrace.com/) is an infrastructure monitoring platform that offers [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) and automated problem remediation.

## Events

The LaunchDarkly Dynatrace integration makes it easier to diagnose problems by sending flag change events to Dynatrace. To learn how, read [Using the Dynatrace events integration](/integrations/dynatrace/events).

## Triggers

LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with Dynatrace. You can use flag triggers to automate flag changes. For example, you can create an alert in Dynatrace that uses a LaunchDarkly trigger to toggle a flag on or off when Dynatrace triggers a predefined or custom event. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with Dynatrace](/integrations/dynatrace/triggers).
