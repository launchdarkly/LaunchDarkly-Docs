## Overview

This topic explains the LaunchDarkly Honeycomb integrations available, including events and triggers.

## About Honeycomb

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) is an observability platform engineering teams use to visualize, analyze, and improve cloud application quality and performance. To sign up for a free Honeycomb account, [visit their signup page](https://ui.honeycomb.io/signup?&utm_source=launchdarkly&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=signup&utm_keyword=&utm_content=free-product-signup).


## Events

The LaunchDarkly Honeycomb events integration helps you diagnose problems by sending flag events to Honeycomb. Honeycomb displays those events alongside performance graphs so you can correlate feature rollouts with changes in operational health. To learn how, read [Using the Honeycomb events integration](/integrations/honeycomb/events).

## Triggers

LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with Honeycomb. You can use flag triggers to automate flag changes. For example, you can create an alert in Honeycomb that uses a trigger to toggle a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with Honeycomb](/integrations/honeycomb/triggers).
