## Overview

This topic explains how to configure and use the LaunchDarkly Datadog events integration.

The Datadog integration lets you set up [Datadog Events](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=bash#events) to receive any activity from LaunchDarkly. When something changes, such as a feature flag updates or a new account member is added to LaunchDarkly, LaunchDarkly sends an event to Datadog. Use this integration to correlate and understand how changes to your features in LaunchDarkly impact your app and infrastructure metrics.

## Prerequisites

To connect Datadog to LaunchDarkly, you need an API Key from Datadog.

To generate an API Key:

1. In Datadog, visit the [API keys page](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys).

2. Click **New Key**. The "New API Key" modal appears. in the "API Keys" section.

3. Give your API Key a human-readable name and click **Create Key**.

4. Click **Copy Key** to copy the API Key to your clipboard. You will need it to set up the Datadog integration in LaunchDarkly.

## Setting up the Datadog integration

After you create an API Key in Datadog, you can set up the integration in LaunchDarkly.

To set up the Datadog integration:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) and find "Datadog."
2. Click **Add integration**. The "Create Datadog configuration" panel appears.
3. (Optional) Give your integration a human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter the Datadog API Key into the **Datadog API key** field. You created this API Key in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.
5. (Optional) Enter a Datadog host URL.
6. (Optional) Check the **Hide member details** checkbox to exclude member names and emails from the events you send to Datadog.

<CalloutDescription>

When **Hide member details** is checked, member-specific events will not be sent to Datadog.

7. (Optional) Configure a custom policy to control which events LaunchDarkly sends to Datadog. To learn more, read [Filtering the events you send to Datadog](#filtering-the-events-you-send-to-datadog).

After you set up the Datadog integration, events from LaunchDarkly appear in your Datadog dashboard.

It may take time for changes made in LaunchDarkly to propagate and appear in the Datadog events dashboard depending on Datadog's polling intervals.

## Filtering the events you send to Datadog

By default, LaunchDarkly sends events to Datadog for changes made to any project, environment, feature flag, and more. If you have a more limited use case for using the integration, or you wish to restrict which data you send to Datadog, you can filter which events LaunchDarkly sends.

To filter events, write a policy using the same syntax as our custom roles feature to filter the events sent to Datadog.

For more information about writing policies, read [Policies in custom roles](/home/members/role-policies).

For example, if you only want to receive an event when a change is made to one of the feature flags in your testing environment, you can add the following policy to your events stream:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example Datadog policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "actions": ["*"],
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/your-test-environment:flag/*"]
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To add a custom filter:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations).
2. Find the integration you wish to modify and click **Edit integration configuration**. The "Edit Datadog configuration" panel appears.

![The "Datadog" section with the "Edit integration configuration" option called out.](datadog-integration-edit-callout.png)

3. Click **Advanced editor**. The Advanced editor appears.
4. Enter your custom policy.

![The "Edit Datadog configuration" panel with the Advanced editor open and a policy inside it.](datadog-custom-policy.png)

5. Click **Save configuration**.
6. Verify that LaunchDarkly is sending a customized set of events by viewing the events in your Datadog dashboard.

## Disabling the Datadog integration

If you wish to disable the Datadog integration, there are two methods to do so:

- **Disable the integration** to pause the flow of events to Datadog, but leaves the connection between Datadog and LaunchDarkly intact.
- **Delete the integration** to cease all event export and break the connection between Datadog and LaunchDarkly.

To temporarily disable the Datadog integration:

1. Navigate to the Integrations page.
2. Find the Datadog integration you wish to disable.
