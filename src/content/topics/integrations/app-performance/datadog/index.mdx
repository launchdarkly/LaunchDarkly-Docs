## Overview

This topic explains the LaunchDarkly Datadog integrations available, including events and triggers.

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a infrastructure & application monitoring service that offers [application performance management (APM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management) and analytics.

## Events

The Datadog events integration lets you set up [Datadog Events](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=bash#events) to receive activity from LaunchDarkly. When something changes, such as a feature flag updates or a new team member is added, LaunchDarkly can send an event to Datadog. To learn how, read [Using the Datadog events integration](/integrations/datadog/events).

## Triggers

LaunchDarkly supports using flag triggers with Datadog. Flag triggers can be used to automate flag behavior. For example, you can create an alert in Datadog that toggles a flag on or off if a performance metric drops below a certain threshold. To learn how, read [Using flag triggers with Datadog](/integrations/datadog/triggers).
