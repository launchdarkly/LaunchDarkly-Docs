The Compass integration for LaunchDarkly displays a timeline of feature flag changes related to a Compass component, as well as a complete list of feature flags and their current state. This helps you visualize how recent changes to feature flags may be impacting component health.

## Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

- Be a Compass administrator on your Atlassian site.
- Have a personal or service API access token. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).

## Set up the Compass integration

The Compass integration is managed from the Atlassian Cloud site. Other than creating an API access token, there are no settings or preferences to configure in LaunchDarkly.

Here's how to set up your Compass integration:

1. Navigate to your Atlassian Compass site. For example, `https://mysite.atlassian.net/compass`.
2. In the top navigation, click **Apps**.
3. Find **LaunchDarkly** in the list of apps and click **Install**.
4. After the LaunchDarkly app is installed, click **Configure**.
5. Click **Allow access**. The "LaunchDarkly is requesting Access" screen appears.
6. Review the requested permissions, then click **Accept**.

## Disconnecting Compass components from LaunchDarkly

The connection between a LaunchDarkly project and a Compass component is stored as a link on the Compass component, as described in the [Connecting Compass components to LaunchDarkly](#connecting-compass-components-to-launchdarkly) section. If desired, you can remove this connection on the Compass component page.

Here's how:

1. Navigate to your Compass site. For example `https://mysite.atlassian.net/compass`.
2. Navigate to the Compass component you want to disconnect from LaunchDarkly.
3. In the **Other links** section of your Compass component, remove the LaunchDarkly link. Verify that the component was successfully disconnected by clicking on the **LaunchDarkly** tab in the left navigation. Feature flag information should no longer display on this tab.

## Disconnecting your API access token

The Compass integration stores your LaunchDarkly API access token to read data from the LaunchDarkly API, as described in the [Setting up the Compass integration](#setting-up-the-compass-integration) section. If you need to cycle your LaunchDarkly access token, or if you want to connect Compass to a different LaunchDarkly organization, you can disconnect your access token.

Here's how:

1. Open to your Atlassian Compass site. For example `https://mysite.atlassian.net/compass`.
2. In the top navigation, click the **Apps** link.
3. Find **LaunchDarkly** in the list of apps and click **Configure**.
4. Click **Disconnect access token**.
5. You can now provide Compass with a new access token if desired.

## Removing the Compass integration

To remove the Compass integration:

1. Open your Atlassian Compass site. For example `https://mysite.atlassian.net/compass`.
2. In the top navigation, click **Apps**.
3. Find **LaunchDarkly** in the list of apps and click **Uninstall**.

This removes the Compass integration with LaunchDarkly.
