## Overview

This topic explains how to use the LaunchDarkly LogDNA integration. [LogDNA](https://www.logdna.com/) is a log management and analysis tool. It allows customers to aggregate and view all server logs in a single place.

LogDNA can provide insights into a service's activity. It aggregates application logs, system logs, and more into a common platform so engineers can view all of their services' activity in a single place.

The LaunchDarkly LogDNA integration sends and aggregates LaunchDarkly audit log events in LogDNA.

With LaunchDarkly activity logs grouped in among your LogDNA service logs, you can more easily correlate feature flag rollouts with changes in logged behavior.

## Prerequisites

To configure the LogDNA integration, you must have a **LogDNA ingestion key**. Generate an integration key from your [LogDNA organization](https://app.logdna.com/manage/api-keys).

## Configuring the integration

Here's how to configure the LogDNA integration:

1. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations) page and find "LogDNA."
2. Click **Add integration**. The "Create LogDNA configuration" panel appears.

4. (Optional) Enter a human-readable **Name**.
5. Paste in your **LogDNA ingestion key**.
7. Specify the **Log level** with which LaunchDarkly messages should be posted. The default value is `INFO`.
7. (Optional) Configure a custom **Policy** to control which information LaunchDarkly sends to LogDNA. To learn more, read [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).
8. Click **Save Configuration**.

When you configure the integration correctly, LaunchDarkly sends change data to LogDNA.

By default, this data is limited to *flag* activity only. You can expand it to other kinds of data, such as project and environment changes.

## Advanced configuration

The "Policy" configuration field lets you control which kinds of events LaunchDarkly sends to LogDNA.

The default policy value restricts it to flag changes in production environments:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="txt"
  values={[
    { label: 'Policy example', value: 'txt', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="txt">

```txt
proj/*:env/production:flag/*
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can override the default policy to restrict exported events to:

- a specific combination of LaunchDarkly projects/environments
- a specific action (or set of actions)
- a specific kind (or kinds) of entities


For example, the example policy below restricts the integration so LaunchDarkly only sends changes from the `web-app` project's production environment to LogDNA:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="txt"
  values={[
    { label: 'Policy example', value: 'txt', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="txt">

```txt
proj/web-app:env/production:flag/*
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more about setting custom policies, read [Policies in custom roles](/home/members/role-policies).

## Using the integration

After you configure the integration, LaunchDarkly events appear in LogDNA log statements similar to log statements from other sources. Data from LaunchDarkly is identified with the `launchdarkly` source. Additionally, they are marked with `env` and `app` values corresponding to the appropriate LaunchDarkly environment and project keys, respectively.

You can include LaunchDarkly events in your view by selecting the `launchdarkly` source from the selector at the top of the LogDNA page. Expand any of these log statements for more details.

LaunchDarkly events also include metadata by which you can filter.

For example, to only view log statements corresponding to the `demo-flag` flag, search for the query string `meta.flag_key:demo-flag`.
