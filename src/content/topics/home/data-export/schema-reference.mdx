## Overview

This topic explains the schema of Data Export events.

Data Export exposes the following kinds of events:

- `feature` events
- `index` events
- `identify` events
- `custom` events
- `alias` events
- `summary` events. To export `summary` events, [contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Some Data Export destinations have different event formatting schema. If you use mParticle or Segment as your event destination, we have specific documentation for their event schema:

* [mParticle schema reference](/home/data-export/mparticle-schema-reference)
* [Segment schema reference](/home/data-export/segment-schema-reference)

These events are described in more detail below.

## Event kinds

This table lists events kinds:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Event kind</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>feature</TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        This event kind includes full-fidelity details of each individual feature flag evaluation. These are only present if you explicitly enable detailed tracking for a feature flag, or if you are using an older SDK.

<CalloutDescription>

The `index` and `identify` event kinds are **not available** for Segment and mParticle destinations.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## SDK versioning for events

Older SDKs always send `feature` events regardless of whether detailed tracking is enabled for that flag. Only newer SDKs generate the `summary` and `index` events described below.

Older SDKs will also send `user` attributes as an object inside `feature` events instead of just providing a "userKey" that can reference user data sent in a prior `index` event.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Enabling detailed analytics events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

To receive `feature` events, in addition to `index`, `identify`, and `custom` events, check the **Send detailed events to data export destinations** checkbox on a flag's **Settings** tab or an environment's **Edit** panel. By default, LaunchDarkly does not export `summary` events. To export `summary` events, <a href="https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact Support</a>.

## Understanding event kind structures

LaunchDarkly sends each of these events as JSON files to your destinations.

All events have the following top level structure:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example event', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
  "project": "5744c96707c9900708000004",
  "environment": "578d1e02d2943862c52b9686",
  "event": {...},
  "version": 1,
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

- `project`: The ID of the LaunchDarkly project associated with the event.
- `environment`: The ID of the LaunchDarkly environment associated with the event.
- `version`: Not in use. The version is always `1`.
- `event`: The event itself. It is an object with a structure described below, depending on the `kind` of event.

## Feature events

`Feature` events represent individual flag evaluations and are considered "full fidelity" events.

Here is an example `feature` event:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Feature event example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
 {
    "kind": "feature",
    "contextKind": "anonymousUser",
    "userKey": "feature@test.com",
    "creationDate": 1462220944000,
    "key": "my.feature.key",
    "variation": 0,
    "variationName": "my variation",
    "value": false,
    "default": false,
    "version": 42,
    "reason": {
      "kind": "FALLTHROUGH"
    },
    "prereqOf": "parent-flag"
 }
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Here is a list of `feature` event properties:

- `kind`: The kind for a `feature` event is `feature`. An SDK only generates a `feature` event if the you set the `trackEvents` attribute of the flag to `true`. You can also control this with settings in the UI.
- `contextKind`: The kind of context which generated an event. This will only be `"anonymousUser"` for events generated on behalf of an anonymous user. It is omitted for events generated on behalf of a non-anonymous user.
- `userKey`: The key of the user object used in a feature flag evaluation. SDKs periodically transmit details for the `user` object used in a feature flag evaluation as reported by the "feature" event with a separate `index` event.
- `creationDate`: When the SDK requested the feature flag, at UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.
- `key`: The key of the feature flag requested.
- `variation`: The variation of the flag requested. The SDK stores flag variation values in an array. This value corresponds to the index of the variation the array. Boolean flags show as `0` or `1` for `true` and `false`, and other flag types are numbered starting with `0` for their different variations.
- `variationName`: The evaluated variation's name, if it exists. If the evaluated variation doesn't have a name, this field doesn't appear.
- `value`: The value of the feature flag returned by feature flag evaluation.
- `default`: (Optional) This value is set to `true` if feature flag evaluation failed, in which case the value returned was the default value passed to `variation`. If the default field is omitted, it is assumed to be `false`.
- `version`: The version of the evaluated feature flag.
- `reason`: (Optional) If a "variation detail" method generates a `feature` event, the event will have a `reason` property with the JSON representation of the [evaluation reason](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons). Evaluations that were part of an experiment have the `inExperiment` attribute on the evaluation reason set to `true`.
- `prereqOf`: attribute should be set to a flag key if this flag evaluation was only performed in order to determine whether the prerequisite values were met for the indicated flag.

## Index events

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Enabling <code>index</code> event exports</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

By default, LaunchDarkly does not export `index` events. To export `index` events, [contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Server-side SDKs send `index` events periodically to describe the attributes of users referenced by the "userKey" in `feature` events.

An example `index` event is shown below:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Index event example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
  {
    "kind": "index",
    "user": {
      "key": "user@test.com",
      "custom": {
        "groups": [
          "microsoft",
          "google"
        ]
      }
    },
    "creationDate": 1462220944000,
  }
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Here is a list of `index` event properties:

- `kind`: The kind of an `index` event is `index`.
- `user`: The same schema as `user` objects for feature flag evaluation.
- `creationDate`: The time this user was recorded at UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Server-side SDKs determine when to send <code>index</code> events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Server-side SDKs have internal logic that determines whether it is necessary to send an `index` event. SDKs do not create `index` events for every flag evaluation. If the SDKs identify the same user multiple times in succession, the SDK does not send multiple `index` events. The SDK identifies users based on the users' keys.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Client-side SDKs do not send `index` events. Instead, Client-side SDKs send `identify` events when the SDK initializes, which include all of the user properties.

## Identify events

`identify` events are produced when the client application calls the `identify` SDK method. `identify` events have a similar structure to "index" events.

An example `identify` event is shown below:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Identify event example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
  "kind": "identify",
  "user": {
    "key": "user@test.com",
    "custom": {
      "groups": [
        "microsoft",
        "google"
      ]
    }
  },
  "creationDate": 1462220944000
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Here is a list of `identify` event properties:

- `kind`: The kind of an `identify` event is `identify`.
- `user`: The same schema as `user` objects for feature flag evaluation.
- `creationDate`: The time this user was recorded at UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.

## Custom events

SDKs produce `custom` events when the client application calls the SDK's track method. To learn more, read [Sending custom events](/sdk/features/events).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>mParticle and Segment schema differences</CalloutTitle>

<CalloutDescription>

The `data` event kind is **not available** for mParticle or Segment events.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

An example `custom` event is shown below:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Custom event example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
  "kind": "custom",
  "user": {
    "key": "user@test.com"
  },
  "creationDate": 1416003645758,
  "key": "custom.event.key",
  "data": {
    "custom": "value"
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Alias events

SDKs produce `alias` events when the client application calls the SDK's alias method. Client-side SDKs also emit them automatically when an anonymous user identifies as a non-anonymous user.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>mParticle and Segment schema differences</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

To read about how <code>alias</code> events function in mParticle and Segment destinations, read their respective schema references.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

An example `alias` event is shown below:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Alias event example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
  "kind": "alias",
  "creationDate": 1600376029000,
  "key": "logged-in-user",
  "contextKind": "user",
  "previousKey": "logged-out-user",
  "previousContextKind": "anonymousUser"
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Summary events

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Enabling <code>summary</code> event exports</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

By default, we do not export <code>summary</code> events. To export <code>summary</code> events, [contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

SDKs send summary events periodically to describe a set of feature evaluations. Summary events include all feature evaluations, regardless of whether the `trackEvents` field was set for individual flags.

An example `summary` event is shown below:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Summary event example', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
{
  "startDate": 1517350765387,
  "endDate":  1517350825243,
  "features": {
    "flag-key": {
      "default": "default-value",
      "counters": [
        {
          "value": "result-value",
          "version": 17,
          "count": 23,
          "variation": 1
        },
        {
          "value": "another-value",
          "version": 17,
          "count": 2,
          "variation": 0
        }
      ]
    },
    "another-flag-key" :{
      "default": "some-other-result-value",
      "counters": [{
        "value": "some-other-result-value",
        "version": 19,
        "count": 29,
        "variation": null
      }],
    "nonexistent-flag-key" : {
      "default": false,
      "counters": [
        {
          "unknown": true,
          "value": false,
          "count": 3,
        }]
    }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The `summary` event represents a set of feature flag evaluations occurring during an interval defined by `startDate` and `endDate`, sorted by feature flag.

Each feature flag includes the following details:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Field</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Meaning</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>default</TableCell>
    <TableCell>The default value the SDK received for the feature, sampled at some point during the interval.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>startDate</TableCell>
    <TableCell>The timestamp of the first feature flag evaluation included in this packet. This value is a UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>endDate</TableCell>
    <TableCell>The timestamp of the last feature flag evaluation included in this packet. This value is a UNIX epoch time in milliseconds.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>counters</TableCell>
    <TableCell>A set of counters as described below.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

The `counters` field is an array of objects with the following contents:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Field</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Meaning</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>version</TableCell>
    <TableCell>The version of the feature flag evaluated.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>value</TableCell>
    <TableCell>The value the SDK returned for the flag evaluation.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>variation</TableCell>
    <TableCell>A zero-based index into the list of variations. If LaunchDarkly does not provide this field, it means the SDK returned a fallback value.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>count</TableCell>
    <TableCell>The number of times this value/version/variation combination was an evaluation result during the interval.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>unknown (optional)</TableCell>
    <TableCell>If this is present and true, it indicates that no flag by this name was known to LaunchDarkly, and therefore the SDK returned the fallback value.</TableCell>
  </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>
