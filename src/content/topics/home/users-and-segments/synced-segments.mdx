## Overview

This topic explains how to create user segments that sync with an Amplitude cohort. Synced segments let you import audiences from Amplitude to LaunchDarkly to more efficiently target and deliver feature flags.

<Feature flagKey="syncedSegments" showWhenVariation={false}>
<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>This feature is for Early Access Program customers only</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

Synced segments are only available to members of LaunchDarkly's Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access to this feature, [join the EAP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ5qCC_RZTW9pPSXVZk9HaKzpltNAeoQb2t6gh7dLicwQWQQ/viewform).

## Prerequisites

In order to set up a synced segment, you must meet the following prerequisites:

<ul>
  <li>You must have an Amplitude account with the LaunchDarkly feature enabled</li>
  <li>You must have a LaunchDarkly access token with write access for the project you want to connect to Amplitude</li>
  <li>You must have a LaunchDarkly client-side ID for the environment you want to connect to Amplitude</li>
  <Feature flagKey="syncedSegments">
    <li>If you are using server-side SDKs, you must have <a href="/home/relay-proxy">the Relay Proxy</a> set up</li>
  </Feature>
</ul>

<Feature flagKey="syncedSegments" showWhenVariation={false}>
<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Synced segments are not available for server-side SDKs or the Relay Proxy</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

 Synced segments are not supported on server-side SDKs or the Relay Proxy.

 Support for Server-side SDKs and the Relay Proxy is in development, but not yet available as part of the Early Access Program. If a server-side SDK or the Relay Proxy evaluates a synced segment, the segment’s target list appears empty in the LaunchDarkly UI.

## Understanding how synced segments work

With synced segments, you can connect a new or existing Amplitude cohort to LaunchDarkly. LaunchDarkly interprets this cohort as a user segment, which makes it convenient for you to target flags to specific user groups or demographics.

In the past, the only option to import a user segment from a third-party tool was to manually upload a CSV file or configure users through the LaunchDarkly API. This manual process was a frequent source of errors. Imported segments needed to be updated manually every time the cohort or user group from the third-party tool changed, which meant that they were frequently out of sync with the real-time population of the cohort.

You can configure synced segments to update automatically in LaunchDarkly at regular intervals, which keeps them current with the existing cohort. We recommend setting up your segment to sync every hour. The process for doing this is documented below.

With synced segments, you can be certain that you're delivering flags to the right user groups precisely and right on time.

## Creating a synced segment

To configure synced segments, you must choose a cohort in Amplitude and tell it to send data to LaunchDarkly. When you do this correctly, the cohort appears as a user segment in LaunchDarkly.

To do this, first [add LaunchDarkly as a destination](#adding-launchdarkly-as-a-destination) and then [sync the cohort](#sync-cohort-to-launchdarkly) to the LaunchDarkly destination.

## Adding LaunchDarkly as a destination

1. Log in to Amplitude and navigate to Sources & Destinations.

![The Amplitude dashboard with the "Sources & Destinations" button called out.](../../images/segments-amplitude-sources-destinations.png)

2. Navigate to the **Destinations** tab and click **Add Destination**.

![The Destinations tab with the "Add Destination" button called out.](../../images/segments-amplitude-add-destination.png)

3. Select the LaunchDarkly Destination. If you don't see LaunchDarkly, you may have to contact Amplitude support to enable the LaunchDarkly feature.

![The Add Destination list with LaunchDarkly called out.](../../images/segments-amplitude-launchdarkly-destination.png)

4. Enter a destination name and add the **access token** and **client-side ID** for your LaunchDarkly project and environment. Select a matching user property in Amplitude to map to LaunchDarkly's User Key. This will most likely be your Amplitude user ID but it depends on your [Amplitude configuration](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/206404628-Step-2-Identifying-your-users). Click save.

5. Verify that LaunchDarkly shows as **Connected**.

## Sync cohort to LaunchDarkly

1. Navigate to the cohort you wish to connect to LaunchDarkly.
2. Click **Sync to...** This opens a new tab with a modal.

![The SuccessCohort screen with the "Sync to..." button called out.](../../images/segments-amplitude-sync.png)

3. Select **Experiment** then **LaunchDarkly** then **next**. If you don't see the LaunchDarkly destination, make sure you have [added LaunchDarkly as a destination](#adding-launchdarkly-as-a-destination). This takes you to the destination configuration screen.

![The "Select Sync Type" screen.](../../images/segments-amplitude-select-sync-type.png)

4. Select your **LaunchDarkly destination** and set the scheduled sync frequency to **hourly**. Click **Sync**.

![The Amplitude destination configuration screen.](../../images/segments-amplitude-destination-config.png)

5. The sync process begins and might take a few minutes to complete. When it finishes, LaunchDarkly appears in the list of Destinations connected to that cohort.

## Synced segments in LaunchDarkly

You can view your synced Amplitude cohort as a segment in LaunchDarkly. It appears in the **Segments** tab with the Amplitude logo in its name.

![The Segments dashboard with the Amplitude-driven segment called out.](../../images/segments-amplitude-dashboard-callout.png)

If you click into that segment, you can see details about its targeting.
