## Overview

This topic explains how to configure SSO integration between a self-hosted Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) server and LaunchDarkly.

ADFS is a service provided by Microsoft as a standard role for Windows Server. It provides a web login using existing Active Directory credentials.

## Prerequisites

To give your team access to LaunchDarkly through ADFS, you need the following components:

- An Enterprise LaunchDarkly account.
- A signed SSL certificate.
- An Active Directory instance where all users have an email address attribute.
