8. Enter role information for the user. The three supported roles are:

- `reader`
- `writer`
- `admin`

9. (Optional) If you are using a custom role, enter the custom role key in the **customRole** field. If a user has multiple custom roles, add them by entering the role keys for each role, separated by commas.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Enter All of a User's Roles</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    When you are configuring a user, you must enter the complete list of the user's roles, including the roles already
    present in LaunchDarkly. This list overrides what is in LaunchDarkly. It does not append to an existing list in
    LaunchDarkly. If you make any changes to the user's name or roles within OneLogin, they update the next time the
    user accesses LaunchDarkly through the OneLogin portal.
  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout> 

10. Click **Save**.

Now this user can access the LaunchDarkly app through OneLogin.

If this is a new user who has never accessed LaunchDarkly before, an account will be automatically created for them when they log in through the OneLogin portal.
