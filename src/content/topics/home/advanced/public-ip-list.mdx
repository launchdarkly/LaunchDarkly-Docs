## Overview

This topic explains how to access LaunchDarkly through one of our public IPs. If you're using a firewall, add a LaunchDarkly IP range to your firewall settings.

## Accessing LaunchDarkly by Domain

### Server Side SDKs

stream.launchdarkly.com for streaming connections (default)
sdk.launchdarkly.com for polling connections
events.launchdarkly.com for sending data back to LaunchDarkly for experimentation analysis

### Client(Web) SDKs

clientstream.launchdarkly.com for streaming and polling connections
events.launchdarkly.com for sending data back to LaunchDarkly for experimentation analysis

### Client(Mobile) SDKs

clientstream.launchdarkly.com for streaming connections (default)
clientsdk.launchdarkly.com for polling connections
mobile.launchdarkly.com for sending data back to LaunchDarkly for experimentation analysis

### Cloudflare Edge SDK

edge-clientsdk.launchdarkly.com for streaming connection only. There are no events collected at edge

 

We generally recommend using streaming over polling when configuring SDKs because the streaming protocol allows us to deliver updates nearly instantaneously.  However, we do always use polling for the initial connection for browser/JS SDK (on page load) and for periodic background requests (defaulting to every 5 minutes) for mobile SDKs (iOS, Android, React Native, etc).


## Accessing LaunchDarkly through a public IP range

To help you access LaunchDarkly services through your firewall, we provide a list of LaunchDarkly's public IP ranges.

Access the list of public IP ranges from this URL: [https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/public-ip-list](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/public-ip-list).

The public IP endpoint returns a JSON object with two attributes:

- `addresses`: This element contains the IP addresses LaunchDarkly uses.
- `outboundAddresses`: This element contains the IP addresses LaunchDarkly uses for outbound webhook notifications. LaunchDarkly uses these addresses when making calls to your network.

You can automate calls to this API to detect when the IP ranges change. We post upcoming changes to this list in advance on our [status page](https://status.launchdarkly.com/).
