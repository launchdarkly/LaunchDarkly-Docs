## Overview

This topic explains how to enable and disable flags in the LaunchDarkly UI.

One-click control of flag behavior is critical to nimble feature management. With LaunchDarkly, you can turn a flag on or off right from the dashboard.

    The flag button lets you turn off a feature that's misbehaving without needing to touch any code or re-deploy your
    application. Wrap the entire feature in a feature flag to control or revoke its rollout seamlessly.",

Flag behavior can do a lot more than just turning features on or off. Continue reading to learn more.

## Turning flags on

When you create a new flag, it is turned **off** by default. You can turn the flag **on** by clicking the flag toggle button in the dashboard or the flag's Targeting tab.

To turn a flag on:

1. Navigate to the dashboard or the **Targeting** tab in the flag detail page.
2. Click the flag toggle. The toggle turns green and displays the word **on**.

To learn more about creating flags, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

## Turning flags off

When you turn a flag to **off**, you disable the targeting rules for that flag. Instead of serving an active variation, you serve the **off** variation.

In the Targeting tab, you can set an **off** variation for both boolean and multivariate flags. Boolean feature flags default to `false` when the feature flag is off.

To turn a flag off:

1. Navigate to the dashboard or the **Targeting** tab in the flag detail page.
2. Set the kill switch to **off**.

If you don't specify an explicit **off** variation, LaunchDarkly serves the fallback value for the flag, which you specified in your code's `variation` calls. This value is indicated at the bottom of the Targeting tab.

  <CalloutDescription>
    You can't schedule a flag for a particular date, but you can use targeting rules to control what it affects and
    when. For example, you can serve `false` to deprecate a feature after a date of your choosing. For more information
    about targeting a flag to appear before or after a date, see [Targeting users](/home/managing-flags/targeting-users).
