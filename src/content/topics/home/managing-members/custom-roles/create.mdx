## Overview

This topic explains how to create and implement custom roles and policies in LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This topic only describes creating custom roles with the basic policy editor</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you need to use custom roles to address a scenario not covered in the documentation, you can write your own policies with the advanced editor. For examples, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Creating a custom role

Before you can give an account member custom permissions in LaunchDarkly, you must create a custom role to assign to them.

To create a custom role:

1. Navigate to **Account settings**.
2. Click into the **Roles** tab.
3. Click **Create role**. The "Create custom role" screen appears.
4. Enter a human-readable **Name** for the role.
5. Enter a **Key** for the role.
6. (Optional) Enter a **Description** to explain what the role does.
7. Create a policy in the "Policy" fields.
8. Click **Save role**:

## Creating policies for custom roles

Policies are sets of actions a custom role is allowed or not allowed to take. You can create policies from the **Roles** tab.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Write policies by hand in the advanced editor</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Advanced users can write custom policies of their own with the Advanced editor.

To learn more about writing your own
policies, read [Using policies](/home/members/role-policies).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To create a policy:

1. Complete the steps in [Creating a custom role](#creating-a-custom-role).
2. In the "Create a role" screen, click into the **Resources** field.
3. Specify a resource this policy affects.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The resource finder can help</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Many common LaunchDarkly items are resources, including flags, metrics, and more. If your LaunchDarkly project is large, it may be difficult to find the exact resource you need.

Click **Resource finder** to choose projects, feature flags, environments, metrics, and roles to add to your policy.

To learn more, read [Finding resource IDs](#finding-resource-ids).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

4. Choose an **Effect** from the dropdown.
5. Choose one or more **Actions** for the policy to enforce:

6. Click **Update**. The results of your policy display:

### Finding resource IDs

You can find resource IDs with the resource finder, which you can access with the “resource finder” link in either the simple or advanced editor, or by using the keyboard shortcut `⌘` + `.` (Mac) or `ctl` + `.` (Windows). All of your environments, members, feature flags, metrics, and roles will be available.

Here is a screenshot of the "Find a resource ID" screen:

## Giving an account member a custom role

After you have created a custom role and policies for it, you must give that role to all members to whom you wish it to apply.

To give a member a custom role:

1. Navigate to **Account settings**.
2. Click into the **Members** tab and find the account member you wish to give a custom role.
3. Click **Manage** beside that account member's name. The member's Settings page opens:

![The member's Settings page.](settings-team-member-edit.png)


4. Click the member's **Role**. A dropdown menu expands.
5. Choose **Custom**. All available custom roles appear with checkboxes beside them:

![The Role dropdown menu.](settings-team-role-dropdown.png)

6. Choose all custom roles you wish to give the member.
7. Click **Save role**:

![Custom roles given to the member.](settings-team-custom-roles-assigned.png)


<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>You must assign roles to members individually</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must add a custom role to one member at a time. You may not apply a role to multiple members simultaneously.

For example, if you wish to add a role for the QA team, you must find each QA account member and add the role to each member individually.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can also assign custom roles through your IdP with SSO or SCIM. For an in-depth guide on how to use custom roles with IdPs, read [Managing custom roles with SSO and SCIM](/guides/platform-specific/custom-roles).

## Viewing an account member's roles

To view the roles for an individual account member, read [Viewing an individual member's roles](/home/members/custom-roles#viewing-an-individual-members-roles).

## Removing an account member's custom role

If an account member changes function or needs their permissions modified, you can remove a custom role from them at any time.

To remove a custom role from a member:

1. Navigate to **Account settings**.
2. Click into the **Team** tab and find the account member you wish to remove a custom role from.
3. Click **Edit** beside that account member's name. The member's Settings page opens.
4. Deselect the checkboxes for the roles you wish to remove from the member.
5. (Optional) If you wish to return the member to a standard role, choose **Reader**, **Writer**, or **Admin / Owner** from the **Role** dropdown:

![The Role dropdown menu.](settings-team-role-dropdown.png)

6. Click **Save role**.

## Viewing custom role details

You can see details about a specific custom role. More information is available on the "Role policy details" screen.

Use the "Role policy details" screen to view detailed information about a custom role, including which projects and feature flags the role has permission to modify. You can also see each action the custom role can perform and what that action does.

Here is a screenshot of the "Role policy details" screen:
