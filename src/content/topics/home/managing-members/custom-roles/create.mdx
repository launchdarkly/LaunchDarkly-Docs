## Overview

This topic explains how to create and implement custom roles and policies in LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>This topic only describes creating custom roles with the basic policy editor</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you need to use custom roles to address a scenario not covered in the documentation, you can write your own policies with the advanced editor. For examples, read [Example policies and templates](/home/members/example-policies).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Creating a custom role

Before you can give an account member custom permissions in LaunchDarkly, you must create a custom role to assign to them.

To create a custom role:

1. Navigate to **Account settings**.
2. Click into the **Roles** tab.
3. Click **Create role**. The "Create custom role" panel appears.
4. Enter a human-readable **Name** for the role.
5. Enter a **Key** for the role.
6. (Optional) Enter a **Description** to explain what the role does.
7. (Optional) Uncheck the "By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content" box for this role to start with no access to any resources.
8. Create a policy in the "Policy" fields.
9. Click **Save role**:

You can also use the REST API: [Create custom role](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Custom-roles#operation/postCustomRole)

### Understanding starting roles

LaunchDarkly uses the built-in Reader role as the starting point for new custom roles when you create them. If you keep the **By default, members can view all LaunchDarkly content** box checked, the custom role starts with Reader permissions. You can use the role's policy to remove view permissions or allow the ability to modify resources.

You can also create custom roles with no access to any LaunchDarkly resources by unchecking the checkbox. To learn how, read [Configuring roles with no access](/guides/tutorials/no-access).

## Creating policies for custom roles

Policies are sets of actions a custom role is allowed or not allowed to take. You can create policies from the **Roles** tab.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Write policies by hand in the advanced editor</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Advanced users can write custom policies of their own with the Advanced editor.

To learn more about writing your own
policies, read [Using policies](/home/members/role-policies).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To create a policy:

1. Complete the steps in [Creating a custom role](#creating-a-custom-role).
2. In the "Create custom role" panel, click into the **Choose resources for this policy statement** field.
3. Specify a resource this policy affects.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The resource finder can help</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Many common LaunchDarkly items are resources, including flags, metrics, and more. If your LaunchDarkly project is large, it may be difficult to find the exact resource you need.

Click **Resource finder** to choose projects, feature flags, environments, metrics, and roles to add to your policy.

To learn more, read [Finding resource IDs](#finding-resource-ids).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

4. Under **Allow or deny actions on the resource**, choose an effect from the menu.
5. Under **Choose actions to allow or deny**, choose one or more actions for the policy to enforce:

![The "Actions" menu with options selected.](settings-roles-resources-action-menu.png)

6. Click **Update**. The results of your policy display:

### Finding resource IDs

You can find resource IDs with the resource finder, which you can access with the “resource finder” link in either the simple or advanced editor, or by using the keyboard shortcut `⌘` + `.` (Mac) or `ctl` + `.` (Windows). All of your environments, members, feature flags, metrics, and roles will be available.

Here is a screenshot of the "Find a resource ID" dialog:

1. Navigate to **Account settings**.
