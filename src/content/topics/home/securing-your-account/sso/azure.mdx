## Overview

This topic explains how to integrate LaunchDarkly with Microsoft Azure.

LaunchDarkly is included in Azure AD's App Gallery. Azure provides a LaunchDarkly application template that facilitates configuration.

## Integrating LaunchDarkly with Azure

To integrate LaunchDarkly with Azure:

1. Log in to Azure.
2. Navigate to your Enterprise applications.
3. Click **New application**:

4. Search for the LaunchDarkly application.

<CalloutDescription>

During configuration, we recommend using the identifier `user.mail` provided that every user has their email
addresses attribute set. If you haven't set attributes for every user, use the identifier `user.userprincipalname`.

## Mapping user attributes

After LaunchDarkly is integrated with Azure, you can map LaunchDarkly role and custom role attributes to Azure using Azure claims. To learn more about SSO provisioning for roles and custom roles, read [Custom attributes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/sso#custom-attributes).

To set up `role` and `customRole` claims in Azure:

1. Navigate to the User Attributes & Claims section.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Click **Add new claim**.
4. Enter `role` in the Name field.
5. Leave the source as "Attribute".
6. Choose a source attribute from the dropdown that is not currently mapped. In this example, we use `user.country`.
7. Click save:

8. Repeat steps 1-7 with `customRole`, mapping to a different unused source attribute.
