## Overview

This topic explains how to enable SCIM user provisioning to work with your SSO-enabled LaunchDarkly account. SCIM facilitates _user provisioning_, which means your IdP can use it to create, update, and deactivate members in LaunchDarkly.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

* You must be a LaunchDarkly Owner / Admin
* You must have enabled SSO. To do this, read [Configuring SAML SSO](/home/account-security/sso/saml).

## Configuring SCIM

In your IdP, begin the workflow that links your IdP with SCIM. The workflow will lead to an authorization screen where you can authorize your IdP to manage your account members.

You may only have one SCIM provider linked to your IdP at once. If you need to change providers, disconnect the original provider by following the workflow below and enable a different one through your IdP.

You cannot deactivate an account member using SCIM deprovisioning if you added the member to your LaunchDarkly account before you enabled SCIM provisioning or SSO.

## User provisioning with SCIM

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>User provisioning with SCIM is an Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

SCIM is only available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

We also have a SCIM API available to allow for user provisioning of account members from IdPs. The SCIM API is only supported for the OAuth2 authorization type. Not all supported third-party providers support user provisioning through SCIM. To learn more about how LaunchDarkly treats users imported from the IdP, read [Understanding default roles](/home/account-security/sso#understanding-default-roles).

We have pre-built integrations with the following providers:

* [Okta](/home/account-security/okta)
* [OneLogin](/home/account-security/onelogin)

You may also configure your provider manually with the following information. Specific names for these fields may vary by IdP:

- SCIM Base URI: `https://app.launchdarkly.com/trust/scim/v2`
- Authorization method: `oauth2`
- Authorization URI: `https://app.launchdarkly.com/trust/oauth/authorize`
- Access token URI: `https://app.launchdarkly.com/trust/oauth/token`
- Unique Identifier field for account members: `userName`
  If you configure your provider manually, you will also need a client ID and client secret. [Contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we will generate these for you.

You cannot create new custom attributes through the SCIM API, but you can set two existing custom attributes for SCIM users:

* `role`
* `customRole`

To learn more about these attributes, read [Custom user attributes](/home/users/custom-attributes).

For an in-depth guide on how to use custom roles with IdPs, read [Creating custom roles](/guides/teams-roles/custom-roles).

## Disconnecting SCIM

You can disconnect SCIM at any time.

To disconnect SCIM:

1. Log into LaunchDarkly as an administrator.
2. Navigate **Account settings** > **Security** and scroll to the "SSO management" section.
3. Click **Disconnect SCIM**.

## Team sync with SCIM

Team sync with SCIM is only available to customers on an Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

LaunchDarkly allows you to sync groups from Okta to teams within your account. You can use this feature to create a new team or link an existing team with the same name to an Okta group.

After you turn on team sync:
* You can only create new teams through Group Push in Okta, and not from the LaunchDarkly UI.
* You can only make changes to your synced teams' names and memberships through Okta. You can still maintain unsynced teams in the LaunchDarkly UI.
* You will still manage team permissions from within LaunchDarkly. To learn how to add custom roles to a team, read [Managing team permissions](/home/teams/managing#managing-team-permissions). Team maintainers and team description will also be managed from the LaunchDarkly UI.
* LaunchDarkly will not delete any existing teams.

To use team sync, you must have administrator access in LaunchDarkly and you must have configured SCIM for your LaunchDarkly account.

To turn on team sync in LaunchDarkly:

1. Log in to LaunchDarkly as an owner or admin.
2. Navigate to the "SSO management" section of the [**Security**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/security) tab on the **Account settings** page.

3. Click **Turn on team sync**. A confirmation dialog appears.
4. Click **Turn on team sync**.

You can now manage teams within the admin panel of Okta. Teams you have synced with Okta have limited team management permissions in LaunchDarkly. To learn more about managing teams in Okta, read [Using Okta to manage LaunchDarkly teams with SCIM](/home/account-security/okta#using-okta-to-manage-launchdarkly-teams-with-scim).

You can tell which teams you have synced on the **Teams** tab in the "Synced with Okta" column:
