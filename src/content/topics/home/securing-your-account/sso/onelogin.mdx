</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Configuring LaunchDarkly's security settings

To enable SAML with OneLogin, you must configure LaunchDarkly's security settings as well as the information OneLogin has about LaunchDarkly.

To configure LaunchDarkly's security settings for SAML:

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** page.
2. Click into the [**Security**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/security) tab.
2. In the "SSO management" section, click **Edit SAML configuration**. The "Edit your SAML configuration" panel appears.
3. Enter configuration information from OneLogin in the appropriate fields.
4. Copy the **Assertion customer service URL** to a secure place. You need it in order to configure OneLogin:

## Configuring your LaunchDarkly app in OneLogin

In the SSO section of your LaunchDarkly application in OneLogin, you'll find the required values for the Sign-on URL as well as your X.509 certificate. You will need to input OneLogin's SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP) value to the Sign-on URL field:

1. Log in to OneLogin.
2. Click **Applications** > **Applications**.
3. Choose the LaunchDarkly app from the list of apps.
4. Navigate to the **SSO** section of your LaunchDarkly OneLogin application.
5. Copy the **OneLogin's SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)** value to a secure place.
6. Open LaunchDarkly in a separate tab. You need information from OneLogin to finish configuration:

## Adding users and setting roles in OneLogin

Now that you have the LaunchDarkly application configured in OneLogin, all that remains is to add user access to the LaunchDarkly app.

To do this:

1. Log in to OneLogin.
2. Click **Applications** > **Applications**.
3. Choose the LaunchDarkly app from the list of apps.
4. Navigate to the **Users** section of your LaunchDarkly OneLogin application.
5. Click on the profile of the user you would like to add as an account member in LaunchDarkly.
6. Click on that user's **Applications** section.
7. Click the **+** in the top right corner.
8. Choose **LaunchDarkly** from the list. The "Edit login" screen appears:

![The "Edit login" screen.](onelogin-edit-user.png)

7. (Optional) Configure the **lastName** and **firstName** fields with user information.
8. Enter **role** information for the user. The three supported roles are:

- `reader`
- `writer`
- `admin`

9. (Optional) If you are using a custom role, enter the custom role key in the **customRole** field. If a user has multiple custom roles, add them by entering the role keys for each role, separated by commas.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Enter all of the roles</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you are configuring a user in OneLogin, you must enter the complete list of the LaunchDarkly account member's roles, including the roles already present in LaunchDarkly. This list overrides what is in LaunchDarkly. It does not append to an existing list in LaunchDarkly. If you make any changes to the name or roles within OneLogin, they update the next time the account member accesses LaunchDarkly through the OneLogin portal.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

10. Click **Save**.

Now this account member can access the LaunchDarkly app through OneLogin.

If this is a new account member who has never accessed LaunchDarkly before, an account will be automatically created for them when they log in through the OneLogin portal.

## User provisioning with SCIM

You can also configure OneLogin to provision users with LaunchDarkly's SCIM API.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Administrator Permissions and SSO are Required</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must be a LaunchDarkly administrator or account owner to complete this procedure. In addition, you must have already enabled SSO by following the procedure above.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To configure OneLogin to provision users:

1. Log in to OneLogin.
2. Click **Applications** > **Applications**.
3. Choose the LaunchDarkly app from the list of apps.
4. Navigate to the **Configuration** section of your LaunchDarkly OneLogin application.

![The OneLogin Configuration screen.](onelogin-configuration-tab.png)


5. Click **Authenticate** in the **API Connection** section. The LaunchDarkly OAuth workflow begins.
6. Click the **LaunchDarkly (SCIM Test)** link. The LaunchDarkly OAuth authorization appears.
7. Click **Authorize** to allow OneLogin to manage your LaunchDarkly account members:

![The LaunchDarkly OAuth permissions screen.](onelogin-ld-authorization.png)


7. In OneLogin, navigate to the **Provisioning** tab.
