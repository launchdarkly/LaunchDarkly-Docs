## Overview

This topic explains how to change which team member has the `owner` role in your LaunchDarkly account, as well as what the `owner` role entails.

## Understanding the owner role

In LaunchDarkly, `owner` is a unique role that only one team member can have. Owners have absolute power over your entire LaunchDarkly account, including the ability to give or remove `admin` privileges from other team members, or to remove the `owner` role from themselves and assign it to someone else.

Every LaunchDarkly account must have an `owner`. By default, the person who creates your LaunchDarkly account is designated as the owner.

To learn more about member roles, read [Managing your team](/home/team/managing).

## Changing account owners

You can change account owners from the **Account Settings** screen.

Only the current owner can change the owner role, and only team members with verified LaunchDarkly accounts can become account owners.

If you are not the owner of your LaunchDarkly account and need to change owners, contact [LaunchDarkly Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us).

If you have not authenticated to LaunchDarkly within the last 10 minutes, you will be prompted to re-enter your credentials during this procedure. Make sure you have access to the account owner's login information before you start.

5. Choose a new team member from the dropdown by clicking or searching.
6. Click **Update owner**. A confirmation screen appears.
7. Confirm that you want to update the account owner by clicking **Change**.

Your permissions change to `admin`. The team member you chose is now the `owner`.
