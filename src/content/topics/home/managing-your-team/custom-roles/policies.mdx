## Overview

This topic explains how policies work in custom roles. 

Policies combine resources and actions into a set of statements that define what users can or cannot do in LaunchDarkly. 

To learn more, read [Custom role concepts](/home/team/role-concepts).

To learn how to create a policy, read [Creating custom roles and policies](/home/team/role-create).

## Understanding policies

Policies are represented as JSON arrays.

Each element in the array is a statement represented as a JSON object with three attributes:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Attribute name</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>effect</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell><code>allow</code> or <code>deny</code>.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>resources / notResources</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        A list of resource specifiers defining the resources to which the statement applies or does not apply.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>actions / notActions</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        A list of action specifiers defining the actions to which the statement applies or does not apply.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Inverse resource and action sets</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

You can only create a statement using `notActions` or `notResources` in the advanced editor.

To learn more about the advanced editor, read [Writing policies in the advanced
editor](#writing-policies-in-the-advanced-editor).

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout> 

The example policy below denies access to a project, identified by it's product key. It also allows all actions on a specific flag in all projects and environments. 

Here's an example policy: 

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Policy', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
[
  {
    "notResources": ["proj/project-key"],
    "actions": ["viewProject"],
    "effect": "deny"
  },
  {
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/*:flag/flag-name"],
    "actions": ["*"],
    "effect": "allow"
  }
]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Custom policies support wildcards</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard character to indicate that all resources or actions should be matched.

In the example above, wildcard characters indicate that the role can perform any action on a particular flag in any project or environment.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

For a more detailed explanation of the policy above, read [Granting all actions to just one flag while showing only one project](/home/team/role-policies#granting-all-actions-to-just-one-flag-while-showing-only-one-project). 

Here's an example statement:


<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'Statement', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
  {
    "effect": "deny",
    "resources": ["proj/*:env/production:flag/*"],
    "actions": ["*"]
  }
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If the environment ID `production` represents the account's Production environment, this statement denies the user from modifying any feature flags in production. 

You can also name an "inverse" set of resources by using `notResources` in a statement. This statement explicitly allows all actions to feature flags across all environments _except_ the production environment.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'notResources statement', value: 'json', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="json">

```json
  {
    "effect": "allow",
    "notResources": ["proj/*:env/production:flag/*"],
    "actions": ["*"]
  }
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Policy algorithm

The algorithm for determining whether access is allowed or denied by a policy is as follows:

- If any statement in the policy explicitly denies access to a resource and action, access is denied.
- If a statement in the policy explicitly allows access to a resource and action, and no statement denies access, access is allowed.
- Any resource or action **not** specifically included in a policy is denied by default.

This means that statement order does not matter.

You can assign multiple custom roles to one member, and each custom role has its own policy. If you assign multiple roles to a member, be aware that if any of those custom roles allow access to a resource, then access is allowed regardless of if other roles deny that access. Adding roles to a user can only increase that user's access.

## Writing policies in the advanced editor

The LaunchDarkly UI has a structured series of fields you can use to create policies.

To learn more about creating policies in LaunchDarkly, read [Configuring custom roles](/home/team).

If you want to write a policy by hand, however, you can use the advanced editor.

To access the advanced editor:

1. Navigate to **Account Settings**.
2. Click into the **Roles** tab.
3. Click **New Role**. The "Create a role" screen appears.
4. Click **Advanced editor**. The advanced editor opens.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Resources are case-sensitive</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

When constructing your policy by hand with the advanced editor, make sure to use the resource key, which is case
sensitive. If the Production environment of your default project has the key `production` then
`proj/default:env/Production` will not allow actions to be taken in your default project's production
environment.

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout> 

## Finding resource IDs

You can find resource IDs with the resource finder, which can be accessed with the “resource finder” link in either the simple or advanced editor, or using the keyboard shortcut `⌘` + `.` (Mac) or `ctl` + `.` (Windows). All of your environments, members, feature flags, metrics, and roles will be available.
