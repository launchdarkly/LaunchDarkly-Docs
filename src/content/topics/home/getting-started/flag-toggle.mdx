## Overview

This topic explains how to enable and disable flags in the LaunchDarkly platform.

One-click control of flag behavior is critical to nimble feature management. With LaunchDarkly, you can turn a flag on or off directly from the flags list.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The flag toggle button is a kill switch for any feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The flag button lets you turn off a feature that's misbehaving without needing to touch any code or re-deploy your application. Wrap the entire feature in a feature flag to control or revoke its rollout seamlessly.

Here is a screenshot of the flags list:

You can also turn a flag on or off from the flag's **Targeting** tab. To learn more about flag targeting, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).

Flag behavior can do a lot more than just turning features on or off. Continue reading to learn more.

## Turning flags on

When you create a new flag, it is turned **Off** by default. You can turn the flag **On** by clicking the flag toggle button in the flags list or the flag's **Targeting** tab.

To turn a flag on:

1. Navigate to the flags list or the **Targeting** tab of a flag.
2. Click the flag toggle. The toggle turns green and displays the word **On**. The variation the flag will serve when you save your changes appears.

3. Click **Review and save**.

To learn more about creating flags, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

## Turning flags off

When you turn a flag to **Off**, you disable the targeting rules for that flag. Instead of serving an active variation, you serve the off variation.

In the **Targeting** tab, you can set an off variation for both boolean and multivariate flags. Boolean feature flags default to `false` when the feature flag is **Off**.

To turn a flag **Off**:

1. Navigate to the flags list or the **Targeting** tab in the flag detail page.
2. Set the toggle to **Off**. The variation the flag will serve when you save your changes appears.

3. Click **Review and save**.

The **Targeting** tab displays this value at the bottom of the tab:

If you don't specify an explicit default off variation, LaunchDarkly serves the fallback value for the flag. You can specify the fallback value in your code's variation calls.

The **Targeting** tab displays the fallback value at the bottom of the tab:

<CalloutTitle>Planning feature flags for future events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can schedule a flag for a particular date using scheduled flag changes, or you can use targeting rules to control what it affects and when. For example, you can serve `false` to deprecate a feature after a date of your choosing, or you can target a specific context or segment to be removed from the flag's targeting settings. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](/home/flags/targeting).
