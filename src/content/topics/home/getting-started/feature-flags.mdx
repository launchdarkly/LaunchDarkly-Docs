## Overview

This topic explains how to create feature flags in LaunchDarkly. You can use feature flags in any aspect of your application, from the customer-facing UI to the back end.

The procedures in this topic assume that you have already configured a LaunchDarkly SDK and are ready to use the LaunchDarkly UI. For an example tutorial of how to configure a LaunchDarkly SDK, read [Configuring an SDK and creating a flag](/guides/tutorials/sdk-flag).

In the LaunchDarkly UI, you can create a new flag, clone and modify an existing flag to create new ones, and set default variations for flags.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>You can use the API instead</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Customers on a Pro or Enterprise plan can also use the LaunchDarkly API to create and manage feature flags, as well as do many other tasks. LaunchDarkly is an API-first product, so everything you can do in the LaunchDarkly API is also available as an API endpoint. To learn more, read our [REST API Documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/).

## Creating a feature flag

You can create and modify feature flags from the dashboard.

To learn more about the dashboard, read [The dashboard](/home/organize/dashboard).

To create a feature flag:

1. Navigate to the Feature flags dashboard.
2. Click **Create flag**. The "Create a feature flag" screen appears:

![The dashboard, with the "Create flag" button called out.](flag-new-callout.png)

3. Enter a unique, human-readable **Name**.
4. Enter a unique flag **Key**. You'll use this key to reference the flag in your code. A suggested key auto-populates from the name you enter, but you can customize it if you wish.
5. (Optional) Enter a **Description** of the flag. A brief, human-readable description helps your account members understand what the flag is for.
6. (Optional) Click into the **Tags** dropdown and choose one or more tags for your flag.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Tags let you sort flags into groups</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Tags are useful for managing flag permissions using custom roles. For example, you can tag a flag as "Marketing" and "DevOps", and then use these tags to determine who has read or write access for the flag. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

7. (Optional) In the "Client-side SDK flag availability" section, check the **SDKs using Mobile Key** and/or **SDKs using client-side ID** boxes to designate which SDKs the flag should be available to. To learn more, read [Making flags available to client-side and mobile SDKs](#making-flags-available-to-client-side-and-mobile-sdks).
8. Choose an option in the **Flag variations** dropdown. To learn more, read [Flag variations](/home/flags/variations).
9. (Optional) Specify details for your **Variation**. To learn more, read [Understanding multivariate flags](/home/flags/variations/#understanding-multivariate-flags).
10. (Optional) Change the **default variations** for the flag's on and off states. To learn more, read [Setting default variations](#setting-default-variations).
11. (Optional) Select the **This is a permanent flag** checkbox.
12. Click **Save Flag**.

You just created a feature flag. It appears in the dashboard.

### Making flags available to client-side and mobile SDKs

By default, flags are only available to server-side SDKs. When you create a flag, you can choose to expose the flag to SDKs which use client-side IDs, SDKs which use mobile keys, or both. If you're using a client-side or mobile SDK, you must expose your feature flags in order for the client-side or mobile SDKs to evaluate them.

Here is an image of the "Client-side SDK availability" section:

![The "Client-side SDK availability" section of the flag creation screen.](flag-create-sdk.png)

If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make all of a project's flags available to client-side or mobile SDKs by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** or **SDKs using Mobile key** checkboxes in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make all of a project's flags available to client-side or mobile SDKs by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** or **SDKs using Mobile key** checkboxes in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Security implications of making flags available to mobile SDKs</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

SDKs for mobile devices use mobile SDK keys, which are readily available to mobile apps. A leaked mobile SDK key allows the holder to circumvent JavaScript's Secure Mode. This can give the holder access to the value of every flag for any user, even without knowing the SDK key that hashes the user key in Secure Mode.

## Configuring the same flag in different environments

All environments within a project have the same set of feature flags. When you create a new feature flag, it is created in every environment in your LaunchDarkly project. That flag is *scoped* to your entire project.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Understanding flag scopes</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Flag scoping refers to the parts of LaunchDarkly where a flag is available or used. If a flag is scoped at the project level, it is available to all environments within the project, because projects contain environments. To learn more about projects, read [Projects](/home/organize/projects).

To learn more about environments, read [Environments](/home/organize/environments).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Flag configuration settings are specific to each environment. The changes you make in one environment do not apply to the same flag in any other environment. If you want to, you can configure the same flag in a unique way for every environment you have.

To configure a flag in a different environment:

1. Navigate to the dashboard.
2. Click the **environment name** in the top left corner. The Switch environment menu appears:

![The Switch environment menu.](env-switcher.png)

3. Search for the environment you wish to switch to and click on it, or choose it from the list. The dashboard for the new environment appears.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Look for the header change</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You know you're in a different environment because the name displayed in the top left corner changes when you select that environment from the list.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

4. Find the flag you wish to modify and make whatever changes you like.

## Setting default variations

When you create a feature flag, some of its variations are designated as *default* variations. You can accept the defaults or change them. When you do this and click **Save Flag**, the flag is created across all environments in your project with these variations set as its `on` and `off` values.

To learn more about default flag variations, read [Changing default flag variations](/home/flags/variations#changing-default-flag-variations).

Here is a screenshot of flag creation screen:

## Cloning flags

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>Cloning flags is a Pro and Enterprise feature</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Cloning flags is available to customers on a Pro or Enterprise plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can also create new flags by cloning existing flags. Instead of creating an entirely new flag with complicated configuration, you can clone and modify an existing flag with similar configuration.

When you clone a flag, LaunchDarkly makes a new flag and copies the original flag's targeting configuration for all environments, including default variations  and whether the flag is toggled on or off.

To clone a flag:

1. Navigate to the dashboard.
2. Find the flag you wish to clone and click its name. The flag detail page opens:

![A flag on the dashboard.](dashboard-flag.png)

3. Click into the flag's **Settings** tab. The flag Settings menu opens.
4. Click **Clone This Flag**. The "Clone feature flag" screen appears:

![The Clone This Flag button.](flag-clone.png)

5. Enter a unique, human-readable **Name**.
6. Enter a unique flag **Key**. You'll use this key to reference the flag in your code. A suggested key auto-populates from the name you enter, but you can customize it if you wish.
7. (Optional) Enter a **Description** of the flag. A brief, human-readable description helps your account members understand what the flag is for.
8. (Optional) Click into the **Tags** dropdown and choose one or more tags for your flag.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Tags sort flags into groups</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Tags are useful for managing flag permissions using custom roles. For example, you can tag a flag as "Marketing" and "DevOps", and then use these tags to determine who has read or write access for the flag. To learn more, read [Custom roles](/home/members/custom-roles).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

9. Click **Save Flag.** You are taken to the new flag's details page:

![The flag cloning configuration screen.](flag-clone-details.png)

The new flag also appears in the dashboard, where you can search for it or access it any time.
