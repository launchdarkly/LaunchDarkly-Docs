## Overview

This topic explains how to use a flag's **Variations** tab to create and edit your feature flag's variations and outlines the different types of flag variations.

Flag variations are available across all environments in a project. Flag targeting is environment-specific. For example, if you add a new flag variation, it is immediately available in all environments in your project. If you change the default targeting rule to serve a different variation, the targeting change only applies to the current environment. To learn more, read [Configuring the same flag in different environments](/home/getting-started/feature-flags#configuring-the-same-flag-in-different-environments).

## Understanding flag types

LaunchDarkly supports boolean and multivariate flags. On the **Variations** tab, you can add, edit, or delete variations of existing flags:

- **Boolean** flags have two variations: `true` or `false`.
- **Multivariate** flags can have more than two variations. The allowed variations depend on the type of flag. Multivariate flag types are strings, numbers, and JSON. To learn more, read [Understanding multivariate flags](#understanding-multivariate-flags).

<CalloutDescription>

After a feature flag has been created, you cannot change the type of its variations. For example, you can't edit a feature flag that returns numbers to make it return strings instead. To learn more about creating flags, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags).

When you add, edit, or delete a feature flag's variations, the change impacts environments within the project.

<CalloutDescription>

When you delete a variation, custom rules that return that variation are also deleted. If a custom rule has a percentage rollout, the rollout for that variation is set to zero. If the default rule returns the deleted variation, it will be changed to return the `off` variation instead.

LaunchDarkly allows you to delete variations that are designated to be served when targeting is off. Make sure that your application is able to handle a null value when targeting is off in case this happens.

## Understanding multivariate flags

Multivariate flags let you use one flag to serve multiple variations of a feature simultaneously. There is no limit to the number of variations you can add to a multivariate flag, making it useful for complex use cases and to manage two or more variations of a feature. For example, a multivariate flag that serves strings as variations can be used to enable different customer checkout types, serving a percentage rollout of those types to users.

Multivariate flag variation types include strings, numbers, or JSON. To learn more, read [Understanding flag types](/sdk/concepts/flag-types#understanding-flag-types).

Here is an image of a flag with a percentage rollout:

You can use custom rules to refine a rollout even more. In this example, the first rule serves two-click checkout to all users whose country is `USA`. The second rule targets users whose email ends with `example.com` and serves one-click checkout to 10%, two-click checkout to 10%, and the original checkout flow to 80% of those users. All users who are not targeted in the custom rules are served the Default rule.

To learn more about targeting rules, read [Creating targeting rules](/home/flags/targeting-users#creating-targeting-rules).

You can also use multivariate flags to perform A/B/n testing with LaunchDarkly's Experimentation feature. To learn more, read [Creating Experiments](/home/experimentation/create).

## Changing default flag variations

When you create a feature flag, some of its variations are designated as *default* variations. A flag's default variations are the variations that are served when a flag is on or off unless you specify otherwise.

For example, a boolean flag could have `false` set as its default **Off** variation and `true` set as its default **On** variation. A multivariate flag could have `variation 1` set as its default **Off** variation and `variation 2` set as its default **On** variation, with `variation 3` and `variation 4` configured to appear in other, more specific circumstances, such as when a user is based in a specific region or has a certain email address.

Default variations are designated automatically every time you create a feature flag. You can accept the default variations or change them. When you do this and click **Save flag**, the flag is created across all environments in your project with these variations set as its `on` and `off` values.

Here is an image of a flag's default variation options:

![The default variation options on the flag creation panel.](flag-create-default-variations.png)

You can change a flag's default variations from the **Variations** tab. Update the default variations in the "Default variations for new environments" section. Subsequent environments you create also use the flag's default values. If you change the default variations and then create a new environment, however, the environment you create will use the updated default variations.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Editing default variations only impacts new environments</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you modify a flag's default variations, the updated default variations only apply to new environments. You can not change the default variations in environments that already exist.
