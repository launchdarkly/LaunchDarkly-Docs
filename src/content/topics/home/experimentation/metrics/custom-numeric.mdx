## Overview

This topic explains how to create a custom numeric metric for an experiment in LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Call track and flush when a user is redirected</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

SDKs send events at regular intervals, such as every five seconds. If a browser redirects a user to another page, any events that occurred between when the SDK last sent events and when browser redirected the user will be lost. To avoid this, call track and then flush when you know the browser will redirect a user to another page, such as on click.

## Creating custom numeric metrics

You can use numeric metrics to track the changes in a value against a baseline value. Unlike conversion metrics, which track whether or not an event occurred, numeric metrics let you measure changes in value against a baseline flag variation you choose.

For example, you can use numeric metrics to track:

- Page load time
- The efficacy of various search algorithms
- The number of items in a shopping cart at checkout

To add a custom numeric metric in LaunchDarkly, you must identify it with a code snippet embedded in your app. Numeric metrics must send a metric event value for each unique user in an experiment for accurate experiment results.

To add a `custom` event:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example event', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
client.track("Example event name", user, null, numericValue);

/* The `user` parameter is omitted in client-side SDKs */
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Like conversion metrics, numeric metrics also require you to create an event name and insert it into your application's code to track metric data. The area of your code you should put custom conversion metric information into, and the type of information you should include, varies based on which SDKs you use.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Numeric metrics must send an event for each unique user</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you use numeric metrics, you must send a metric event value for each unique user in an experiment. If your unique user count and metric event value count are not the same, LaunchDarkly cannot accurately calculate the results for your experiment. When this happens, an alert appears on the Experimentation tab of the feature flags included in the experiment.

Usually, the information you should put in your code includes the event key, user object, data field, or numeric value fields. To learn more, read [Sending custom events](/sdk/features/events).

If the feature described below is not available in your "Create a new metric" panel, your SDKs may be out of date. To solve this problem, update your SDKs to the latest version, and [contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us) to enable numeric metrics.

To create a numeric metric:

1. Follow steps 1-7 in [Creating click metrics](/home/experimentation/metrics/click) until you have configured the metric up to the "Event information" section.
2. Click the **Event kind** menu and select "Custom."
3. Select the **Numeric** radio button.
4. Enter a human-readable **Event name**. This is the event name you will reference in your code snippet when you insert the metric information into your app.
5. Enter a **Unit of measure** to track.
6. Choose a **Success criteria** from the menu.
7. Click **Save metric**:

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Choosing success criteria for numeric metrics</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

When you designate a success criteria, you can choose **Lower than baseline** or **Higher than baseline** depending on what you want to track. For example, if you're trying to track page load time to measure the impact of your infrastructure changes, you might want a success criteria that is lower than the baseline if your baseline flag variation shows the original page load time and you want to measure decreases in page load time.

After you create a metric, you can connect it to an experiment. To learn how, read [Building experiments](/home/experimentation/create#building-experiments).
