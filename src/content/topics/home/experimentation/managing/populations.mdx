## Overview

This topic explains what an experiment population is, and how to use LaunchDarkly's features to show experiments only to a specific group of users.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>These methods are only for accounts that do not use allocation</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Most LaunchDarkly accounts use allocation to control their experiment traffic, instead of the methods described below. Only use the methods on this page if allocation is not enabled for your account. To learn how to customize your experiments using allocation, read [Allocating experiment traffic](/home/experimentation/allocation). If you are unsure whether your account has allocation enabled, [contact Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us).

## Understanding experiment populations

You have the option to only include a subset of users in your experiments, which gives you accurate experiment results more quickly. This subset of users is called your "experiment population."

You can create a custom experiment population by selecting specific flag targeting rules to include in your active experiments. To learn more, read [Defining the audience for an experiment](/home/experimentation/create#defining-the-audience-for-an-experiment).

<CalloutTitle>Can't see the "Configure event settings" options?</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you can't see the feature described below, your SDKs may be out of date. To solve this problem:

1. Update your SDKs to the latest version.
2. Contact support@launchdarkly.com to enable the feature.

## Customizing experiment populations

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Experiment allocation</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you have experiment allocation enabled, customizing your experiment populations works differently than described below. To learn how to customize your experiments with experiment allocation enabled, read [Allocating experiment traffic](/home/experimentation/allocation).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can refine your user base into a specific experiment population by following the procedure below.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Customizing events for Data Export</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

To learn how to configure which user data LaunchDarkly sends to Data Export destinations, read [Customizing which data LaunchDarkly exports](/home/data-export#customizing-which-data-launchdarkly-exports).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To customize your experiment population:

1. Identify which flag is associated with the experiment you wish to modify.
2. Navigate to that flag's **Settings** tab.
3. Click **N of N targeting rules** in the "Exporting events from" line. The "Configure event settings" screen opens:

![A flag's Settings page with the targeting rules link called out.](flag-settings-experiments-targeting-rules-callout.png)


4. Click the **Custom selection** radio box to modify the users who can see an experiment. When you click **Custom selection**, you can choose which targeting rules you wish to include or exclude from an experiment. If you use controlled populations and choose **Custom selection**, the experiment excludes all users who return a `PREREQUISITE_FAILED` evaluation reason. To learn more about flag prerequisites, read [Prerequisite checks](/sdk/concepts/flag-evaluation-rules#prerequisite-checks).
5. Select the checkboxes of rules you wish to include in the experiment. This refines the experiment's population down to the group you choose:

![The "Configure event settings" menu with some targeting rules selected.](experiments-rules-custom-selection.png)


5. Click **Save Changes**. A confirmation dialog appears.
6. Type the name or key of the environment in the text box and click **Confirm**.

The modified list of users you created is now the experiment's population.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Experiment populations do not affect flag targeting rules</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can customize your experiment's population at will without your flag targeting rules changing. Flag targeting controls which variation of a flag a user sees. An experiment's population determines which of your users contribute to Experimentation results or Data Export streams. To learn more, read [Targeting users](/home/flags/targeting-users).

## Changing targeting rules during an experiment

If you update a feature flag's targeting rules while an experiment is running, a user who previously saw one variation may then see a different variation. Data for that user is recorded twice, because LaunchDarkly deduplicates user data only at the variation level, not the flag level. To prevent the experiment from recording user data twice, restart it after you make any changes to a flag's targeting rules. This clears all existing data from the experiment.

To restart the experiment:

1. Find the feature flag associated with your experiment.
2. Click on the flag's **Experimentation** tab.
3. Click on the overflow menu in the relevant experiment.
4. Click **Reset data**.

The data from the experiment is now cleared.
