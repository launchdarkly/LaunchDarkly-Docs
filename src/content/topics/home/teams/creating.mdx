Use the **Teams** tab to create new teams or to edit existing teams, add and remove members to and from teams, and control what permissions the team has using custom roles.

To create a new team:

1. Navigate to [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings) and click into the [Teams](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/teams) tab.
2. Click **Create Team**. The "Create team" modal appears.
3. Give the team a human-readable **Name**. The team's unique **Key** generates below based on the name you enter.
4. (Optional) Modify the team's **Key** if you follow naming practices that require it.
5. (Optional) Enter a **Description.**

8. Click **Create team.**
