## Overview

This topic explains how to view flags across multiple environments.

Viewing your flags across multiple environments allows you to compare the targeting, variations served, default variations, and off variations of your feature flags.

To learn how to copy a flag from one environment to another, read [Comparing and copying flag settings across environments](/home/organize/flag-compare-copy).

## Viewing flags across environments

To view flags across environments:

1. Navigate to the flags dashboard.
2. Find the flag you wish to view and click the overflow menu:

3. Click **Overview across environments**. The "Overview across environments" screen appears.

If there are certain environments you want to pin to the top of the list, search for them in the "Pin environments for easier comparison" dropdown.
