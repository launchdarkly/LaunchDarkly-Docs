## Overview

This topic explains how you can use the `ld-find-code-refs` utility with CircleCI to automatically populate code references in LaunchDarkly.

## Prerequisites

To complete this procedure, you must have the following prerequisites:

- An API access token with `writer` permissions. To learn more, read [API access tokens](/home/account-security/api-access-tokens).
- The LaunchDarkly [CircleCI Orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs).

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>Circle Workflow version 2.1 or higher is required</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>
    To use CircleCI Orbs, you must be using a Circle Workflow version of 2.1 or higher. If you're using an earlier
    version, try manually using the utility{' '}

      label="binary or docker image"
    />{' '}
    to create your own workflow job.

## Setting up the LaunchDarkly CircleCI integration

To set up the LaunchDarkly orb in CircleCI:

1. Save your API access token as an environment variable titled `LD_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your CircleCI project settings. To learn more, read [CircleCI's documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).
2. Create a YAML file in CircleCI with configuration including LaunchDarkly's Orb.
   Here's an example minimal configuration using LaunchDarkly's Orb:

<CodeTabs
 defaultValue="yaml"
 values={[
   { label: 'YAML', value: 'yaml', },
 ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  launchdarkly: launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs@2.4.0

workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - launchdarkly/find-code-references:
          proj_key: $YOUR_LAUNCHDARKLY_PROJECT_KEY
          repo_type: github # can be 'github', 'bitbucket', or 'custom'
          repo_url: $YOUR_REPO_URL # used to generate links to your repository
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Additional configuration options

There are more configuration options for the Code references orb. To learn more, read [Explore Orbs / launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs](https://ld.click/CircleCIOrbs).

Skip searching files and directories with an [`.ldignore`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#ignoring-files-and-directories) file.

Use the [`.launchdarkly/coderefs.yaml`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#advanced-yaml-configuration) file for advanced configuration, such as configuring custom delimiters and aliases for your flag keys.
