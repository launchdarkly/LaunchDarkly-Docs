## Overview

This topic explains what the different flag statuses are, and how to view them in the LaunchDarkly UI.

## Using the flag status indicator

The flag status indicator lets you see when a flag is active or inactive. It's important to understand flag statuses so you know which flags are safe to remove from your code.

Every feature flag has a status that reflects the state of a flag in each environment.

For example, if the flag is listed as "Active" in your Production environment, LaunchDarkly is currently receiving requests for that flag using your Production SDK key.

The various flag statuses are explained below:
