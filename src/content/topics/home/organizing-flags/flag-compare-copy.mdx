## Overview

This topic explains how to use the compare flags feature to view and copy flag configurations across different environments.

## Comparing and copying flags across environments

You can compare and copy flag configurations between two environments. To compare a flag, it must have at least two versions, one in each of the environments you wish to compare.

To compare and copy a flag:

1. Navigate to the flag dashboard and click the **overflow menu**.
2. Choose "Compare flags." The "Compare flags" screen appears.

3. Choose two environments from the **Source environment** and **Target environment** menus. Flags appear below the menus indicating the differences between the two environments:

4. Click a flag's row to view more details about how the flag versions differ between the two environments. This view is similar to a code diff. The current flag configuration for the **Target environment** appears on the left. The proposed flag configuration appears on the right. The proposed flag configuration is the flag variation from the **Source environment**.
5. Select checkboxes to choose which settings you would like to copy over from the **Source environment**:

6. Click **Copy settings** to save the changes. You may optionally select a drop down to request approval from another member before the changes take effect.
7. If the environment you're copying changes to requires approval, you will be prompted to request approval from another member. To learn more, read [Approval workflows](/home/feature-workflows/approvals).

<CalloutTitle>Restrictions on custom targeting rules</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can copy all custom targeting rules simultaneously with the **Select all** checkbox. However, if one of your rules references a segment that does not exist in the target environment, you cannot copy any targeting rules. You will still be able to copy Targeting state, Prerequisites, Individual user targets, Default rule, and fallback rule ("If targeting is off, serve").
