## Overview

This topic explains how to use the flag dashboard, which shows your feature flags and gives you options to create, modify, and manage them.

## Viewing feature flags

All of your feature flags within a project appear on the flag dashboard. Creating a new flag adds it to the dashboard and all environments within your project, and archiving a feature flag removes it from the dashboard and all environments within your project.

Here is an image of the flag dashboard:

To learn how to create a new flag, read [Creating a feature flag](/home/getting-started/feature-flags#creating-a-feature-flag). To learn how to archive a flag, read [Archiving flags](/home/code/flag-archive#archiving-flags).

Use the search bar to find a flag by name, tag, key, or description. You can sort the list of visible flags to identify the oldest or most recent, or to view them in alphabetical order. By default, the most recently created flags appear first.

## Filtering feature flags

You can filter the list of flags on your dashboard to view only flags that share a particular attribute, such as a tag, a status, or an availability to an SDK type.

To filter your flags:

1. Click **Filter**.
2. Choose an attribute from the menu.
3. Choose a value to filter by from the second menu:

4. Click **Add**.

Your dashboard now displays only the flags that match the filter you specified.

To add additional attributes to your filter, repeat steps 1-4. The dashboard displays only flags that match all of the attributes you selected.

To remove a filter, click on the attribute name you want to stop filtering by and click **Clear filter**. To remove multiple filters, click **Clear all**:

## Saving dashboards

You can save your dashboard filter configurations to return to later.

To save a dashboard:

1. Apply your desired filters.
2. Click **Save**. The "Save current dashboard" dialog appears.
3. Enter a name for the dashboard:

4. Click **Save dashboard**.

To later load your saved dashboard, expand the **Save** menu and click on the dashboard you want to view:

Your dashboard now displays with the saved filters.
