Web browsers vary widely in their support of specific features and standards. It is common in JavaScript development to use [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill)—scripts that implement a feature in case it is not built into the browser—to ensure the widest possible compatibility.

Three features that are used by the LaunchDarkly SDK that may not be available on every browser are `Promise`, `EventSource`, and `document.querySelectorAll()`.

## Methods of adding a polyfill

For all of these features, there are two ways you can provide the polyfill script.

One is to load it directly from a CDN that hosts the package, with a `<script>` tag within the `<head>` element of your page. Note that you must put the `<script>` tag for the polyfill _before_ any scripts that make use of the LaunchDarkly SDK.

Here is how to load it directly from a CDN:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="html"
  values={[
    { label: 'HTML', value: 'html', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="html">

```html
<script src="[URL of the polyfill script]"></script>
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you are using a package manager such as NPM or Yarn, and using `require()` to load modules at runtime, you would first add the polyfill package to your project:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```bash
npm install package-name-of-polyfill@package.version.number
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Then, make sure that you `require` the polyfill module prior to initializing the LaunchDarkly client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
require('package-name-of-polyfill');
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You only need to use one of these methods—CDN or package manager—not both.

## Promise

The SDK relies heavily on JavaScript Promises. [Browsers that do not support Promise](https://caniuse.com/#search=Promise) include Internet Explorer and older versions of Microsoft Edge. If you need to support these browsers, you will need to install a polyfill for Promise, such as [es6-promise.](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise)

To install a polyfill for Promise:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="html"
  values={[
    { label: 'HTML', value: 'html', },
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'shell', },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="html">

```html
<!-- loading polyfill from CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/es6-promise@4.2.4/dist/es6-promise.auto.min.js"></script>
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="shell">

```bash
# installing polyfill as a package
npm install es6-promise@4.2.4
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
// loading polyfill as a package
require('es6-promise/auto');
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## EventSource

The SDK uses [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) to provide a live streaming connection to LaunchDarkly, if you have enabled streaming (by using the `streaming` property or the `setStreaming` method, or by subscribing to `change` events). **If you never enable streaming, you do not need `EventSource`.**

It is widely available in browsers, [except for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge](https://caniuse.com/#search=EventSource). If you want to support these, and you need streaming support, you can install a polyfill such as [event-source-polyfill](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).

To install a polyfill:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="html"
  values={[
    { label: 'HTML', value: 'html', },
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'shell', },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="html">

```html
<!-- loading polyfill from CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/event-source-polyfill@0.0.12/src/eventsource.min.js"></script>
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="shell">

```bash
# installing polyfill as a package
npm install event-source-polyfill@1.0.5
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
// loading polyfill as a package
require('event-source-polyfill');
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>


## `document.querySelectorAll()`

The SDK uses `querySelectorAll` to support click events for A/B testing. **If you never use click goals, you do not need `querySelectorAll`.**

It is widely available in browsers, [except in old versions of Internet Explorer](https://caniuse.com/#feat=queryselector). If you want to support these, and you need A/B testing support, you can install a polyfill such as [polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).

To install a polyfill:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="html"
  values={[
    { label: 'HTML', value: 'html', },
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'shell', },
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="html">

```html
<!-- loading polyfill from CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/polyfill-queryselector@1.0.2/querySelector.js"></script>
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="shell">

```bash
# installing polyfill as a package
npm install polyfill-queryselector@1.0.2
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
// loading polyfill as a package
require('polyfill-queryselector')

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
