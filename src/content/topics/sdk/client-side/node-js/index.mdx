LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and a sample application:

<CalloutTitle>For use in mobile, desktop, and embedded client applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in single-user mobile, desktop, and embedded applications. If you have a Node.js application and want to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, read the [server-side Node.js SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/node-js). If you are using Electron, there is an [Electron SDK](/sdk/client-side/electron) more specifically designed for that environment.

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This SDK is closely related to the [browser JavaScript SDK](/sdk/client-side/javascript) and has almost exactly the same API, but does not have any browser-specific functionality and adds several features specific to Node.

The sample code snippets for this SDK are available in both JavaScript and TypeScript. To learn more, read [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Node.js code.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Installing with yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install launchdarkly-node-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```json
yarn add launchdarkly-node-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const LaunchDarkly = require('launchdarkly-node-client-sdk');
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-node-client-sdk';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. To create a client instance, you need your environment's client-side ID. This authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly. Your client-side ID is available in the Projects tab of your [Account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects). Client-side IDs are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Feature flag targeting and rollouts are determined by the active user. You must pass a user context to the SDK during initialization before requesting any feature flags with `variation`. Failure to pass a valid user context to the SDK during initialization will result in an error.

Here's how to initialize the client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'aa0ceb'
};

const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
const user: ld.LDUser = { key: 'aa0ceb' };
const client: ld.LDClient = ld.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The client emits a `ready` event when you have initialized it. You can also use the `waitForInitialization()` method, which returns a Promise. After you have initialized it, you can safely call `variation` to access your feature flags. The SDK emits the `ready` event only once, when the client first initializes. In a production application, your calls to `client.variation` would normally not be inside of this event handler.

To emit a `ready` event:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log("It's now safe to request feature flags");

  const showFeature = client.variation("YOUR_FEATURE_KEY", false);

  if (showFeature) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log("It's now safe to request feature flags");

  // initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
  const boolFlagValue = client.variation('key', false) as boolean;
  const numberFlagValue = client.variation('key', 2) as number;
  const stringFlagValue = client.variation('key', 'default') as string;
  // etc.

});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Streaming updates</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK does not subscribe to streaming real-time updates automatically when you initialize it. Setting the `streaming` option to `true` in the client configuration causes the SDK to open a streaming connection to LaunchDarkly and receive live feature flag updates. You can also specify an event handler with `client.on('change')` to be notified immediately when a flag changes.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's Settings tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).
