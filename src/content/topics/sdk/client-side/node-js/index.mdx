<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in mobile, desktop, and embedded client applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in single-user mobile, desktop, and embedded applications. If you have a Node.js application and want to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, read the [server-side Node.js SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/node-js). If you are using Electron, there is an [Electron SDK](/sdk/client-side/electron) more specifically designed for that environment.

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This SDK is closely related to the [browser JavaScript SDK](/sdk/client-side/javascript) and has almost exactly the same API, but does not have any browser-specific functionality and adds several features specific to Node.

The sample code snippets for this SDK are available in both JavaScript and TypeScript, where the sample code differs. To learn more, read [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Node.js code.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application using your application's dependency manager.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Installing with yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install launchdarkly-node-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```json
yarn add launchdarkly-node-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const LaunchDarkly = require('launchdarkly-node-client-sdk');
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
import * as LaunchDarkly from 'launchdarkly-node-client-sdk';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. To create a client instance, you need your environment's client-side ID. This authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly. Your client-side ID is available in the Projects tab of your [Account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects). 

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Client-side IDs are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. However, never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Feature flag targeting and rollouts are determined by the active user. You must pass a user context to the SDK during initialization before requesting any feature flags with `variation`. Failure to pass a valid user context to the SDK during initialization will result in an error.

Here's how to initialize the client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const user = {
  key: 'aa0ceb'
};

const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
const user: LaunchDarkly.LDUser = {
  key: 'aa0ceb'
};
const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The client emits a `ready` event when you have initialized it. You can also use the `waitForInitialization()` method, which returns a Promise. After you have initialized it, you can safely call `variation` to access your feature flags. The SDK emits the `ready` event only once, when the client first initializes. In a production application, your calls to `client.variation` would normally not be inside of this event handler.

To emit a `ready` event:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
client.on('ready', () => {
  // initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
  const flagValue = client.variation('YOUR_FEATURE_KEY', false);
  // etc.
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
client.on('ready', () => {
  // initialization succeeded, flag values are now available
  const boolFlagValue = client.variation('YOUR_FEATURE_KEY', false) as boolean;
  const numberFlagValue = client.variation('YOUR_FEATURE_KEY', 2) as number;
  const stringFlagValue = client.variation('YOUR_FEATURE_KEY', 'default') as string;
  // etc.
});
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Streaming updates</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK does not subscribe to streaming real-time updates automatically when you initialize it. Setting the `streaming` option to `true` in the client configuration causes the SDK to open a streaming connection to LaunchDarkly and receive live feature flag updates. You can also specify an event handler with `client.on('change')` to be notified immediately when a flag changes.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's Settings tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).
