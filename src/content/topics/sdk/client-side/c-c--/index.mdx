## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the client-side C/C++ SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<Callout intent="primary">
<CalloutTitle>SDK quick links</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and sample applications:

## Prerequisites

To use the C/C++ SDK, you must have the following prerequisites:

* Windows or a POSIX environment (Linux, OSX, BSD)
* The networking library `libcurl`
* `libpthread`, if you are using a POSIX environment

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in mobile, desktop, and embedded client applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in single-user mobile, desktop, and embedded applications. If you have a C/C++ application and want to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, read the [server-side C/C++  SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/c-c--).

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

</CalloutDescription>

## Configuring the SDK

The following sections explain how to install and configure the SDK, and then to verify its connection to LaunchDarkly by fetching flag configuration information for a specific user.

### Installing the SDK

Here's how to install the SDK:

1. Clone [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk) or download a release archive from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/releases) page.
2. Install the SDK locally.
 * If you use `cmake`, the build system will expect that `libcurl`, and `libpthread` if you are on POSIX, exist on the system. The `cmake` configuration exports the target `ldclientapi`.
 * If you don't use `cmake` and you cannot use LaunchDarkly's artifacts, use `cmake install` to install the SDK in directory you choose. This copies the required headers, and binaries equivalent to LaunchDarkly's release bundles.
3. Build the C++ wrapper, which is not included in the release binaries. Copy the [header](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/blob/master/cpp/include/launchdarkly/api.hpp) and [source](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/blob/master/cpp/api.cpp) files and add them to your own build system.
4. Include the LaunchDarkly SDK headers:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c' },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
#include <launchdarkly/api.h>
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="cpp">

```c
#include <launchdarkly/api.hpp>
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

5. Create a single shared instance of `LDClient`.
6. Specify your *mobile key* to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c' },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp' }
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
unsigned int maxwaitmilliseconds = 10 * 1000;
struct LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY");
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("YOUR_USER_KEY");
struct LDClient *client = LDClientInit(config, user, maxwaitmilliseconds);
```

</CodeTabItem>

<CodeTabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
unsigned int maxwaitmilliseconds = 10 * 1000;
struct LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY");
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("YOUR_USER_KEY");
LDClientCPP *client = LDClientCPP::Init(config, user, maxwaitmilliseconds);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Your environment's mobile key is available in the Projects tab of your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). 

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Mobile keys are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. However, never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

### Fetching flag configuration

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's Settings tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here's how to verify the SDK is configured correctly by fetching flag configuration data from LaunchDarkly:

1. Call `LDClientInit` to initiate a remote call to the LaunchDarkly service. This fetches the feature flag settings for a given user.

 This call blocks up to the time defined by `maxwaitmilliseconds`. If you request a feature flag before initialization completes, you will receive the default flag value. If you want to wait for client initialization, register a callback:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C/C++', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
void initCallback(LDStatus status)
{
    if (status == LDStatusInitialized) {
        printf("Completed LaunchDarkly client initialization");
    }
}

LDSetClientStatusCallback(initCallback);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

2. Use `client` to check which variation a specific user should receive for a certain feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c' },
    { label: 'C++', value: 'cpp' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
bool show_feature = LDBoolVariation(client, "YOUR_FLAG_KEY", false);
if (show_feature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>

<CodeTabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
bool show_feature = client->boolVariation("YOUR_FLAG_KEY", false);

if (show_feature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Shutting down

Shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#cc-client-side).
