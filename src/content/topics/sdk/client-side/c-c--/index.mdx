<CalloutTitle>Version 3 of the C++ (client-side) SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts replace another data object in LaunchDarkly: "users."

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [C++ (client-side) SDK 2.x to 3.0 migration guide](/sdk/client-side/c-c--/migration-2-to-3) and [Best practices for upgrading users to contexts](/guides/flags/upgrading-contexts).

## Prerequisites and dependencies

To use the C++ SDK, you must have the following prerequisites installed on your build machine:

- Windows or a POSIX environment (Linux, OSX, BSD)
- `cmake`, version 3.19 or above
- `boost`, version 1.81 or above
- `openssl`, version 1.1 or above
- `libpthread`, if you are using a POSIX environment

To build the C++ SDK, you must have the following dependencies. These are automatically fetched by `cmake` during the build process:

- [`tl/expected`](https://github.com/TartanLlama/expected)
- [`djarek/certify`](https://github.com/djarek/certify.git)

If you are planning to run the C++ SDK test suite, you will also need the following:

- [`nlohmann/json`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
- [`googletest`](https://github.com/google/googletest)

You do not need to run the test suite in order to use the SDK.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in mobile, desktop, and embedded client applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in single-user mobile, desktop, and embedded applications. If you have a C/C++ application and want to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, read the [server-side C/C++ SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/c-c--).

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Version 3 of the C++ (client-side) SDK is a native C++ library </CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Previous versions of this SDK were written in C, with a C++ wrapper available. In version 3.0 and higher, this SDK is written in C++, with a C wrapper available. The code samples below show all options, where applicable.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you complete the [Getting started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly C++ SDK.

The following sections explain how to install and configure the SDK, and then to verify its connection to LaunchDarkly by fetching flag configuration information for a specific context.

### Incorporating the SDK

You can incorporate the SDK by building from source using `cmake`, or by using pre-built artifacts. Then, include the LaunchDarkly headers.

#### Incorporating the SDK using cmake

---

<br />

To incorporate the SDK using `cmake`:

1. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/cpp-sdks) as a subdirectory of your project.
2. Update your project's `CMakeLists.txt` to include the SDK repository:
    <CodeSample>
    <CSTab label="Using add_subdirectory">
    ```bash
    add_subdirectory(cpp-sdks)
    ```
    </CSTab>
    </CodeSample>
3. Link your project's target against the `launchdarkly::client` target:
    <CodeSample>
    <CSTab label="Linking your target">
    ```bash
    target_link_libraries(your-target PRIVATE launchdarkly::client)
    ```
    </CSTab>
    </CodeSample>

#### Incorporating the SDK using prebuilt artifacts

---

<br />

The C++ (client-side) SDK releases include 64-bit static and dynamic libraries for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

To incorporate the SDK using prebuilt artifacts:

1. Download the correct release for your platform from the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/cpp-sdks/releases?q=%22launchdarkly-cpp-client%22) page.
2. Ensure the SDK's headers are installed on the build system. One way to do this is to clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/cpp-sdks) and install the headers using `cmake`:
    <CodeSample>
    <CSTab label="Install headers">
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    cmake --install .
    ```
    </CSTab>
    </CodeSample>

You can now reference the installed headers and link against the prebuilt libraries.

#### Including the LaunchDarkly headers

---

<br />

To include the LaunchDarkly SDK headers:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3 (native)">

```c
#include <launchdarkly/client_side/client.hpp>
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3 (C binding)">

```c
#include <launchdarkly/client_side/bindings/c/sdk.h>
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The C wrapper is included in the release binaries.

<Details summary="Expand for how to install the SDK if you are using v2.x">

Here's how to install the SDK:

1. Clone [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk) or download a release archive from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/releases) page.
2. Install the SDK locally.

- If you use `cmake`, the build system will expect that `boost` and `openssl` exist on the system. The `cmake` configuration exports the target `ldclientapi`.
- If you don't use `cmake` and you cannot use LaunchDarkly's artifacts, use `cmake install` to install the SDK in directory you choose. This copies the required headers, and binaries equivalent to LaunchDarkly's release bundles.

3. (Optional) Build the C++ wrapper, which is not included in the release binaries. Copy the [header](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/blob/master/cpp/include/launchdarkly/api.hpp) and [source](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-client-sdk/blob/master/cpp/api.cpp) files and add them to your own build system.
4. Include the LaunchDarkly SDK headers:

    <CodeSample>
    <CSTab label="C">

    ```c
    #include <launchdarkly/api.h>
    ```

    </CSTab>
    <CSTab label="C++">

    ```cpp
    #include <launchdarkly/api.hpp>
    ```

    </CSTab>
    </CodeSample>

</Details>

### Understanding the SDK namespaces

SDK components common to the C++ (client-side) SDK v3.0 and the upcoming C++ (server-side) SDK v3.0 exist within the top-level `launchdarkly` namespace. Client-side components exist within `launchdarkly::client_side`.

To keep the examples in our documentation concise, we assume symbols in the top-level `launchdarkly` namespace are visible. You can bring `launchdarkly`, `launchdarkly::client_side`, or both into scope, or you can refer to SDK components by their fully-qualified names.

For example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Using launchdarkly namespace">

```cpp
using namespace launchdarkly; # omitted in examples; assumed to be present
auto config = client_side::ConfigBuilder("mobile-key-123abc").Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Using launchdarkly::client_side namespace">

```cpp
using namespace launchdarkly::client_side;
auto config = ConfigBuilder("mobile-key-123abc").Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="No namespace">

```cpp
auto config = launchdarkly::client_side::ConfigBuilder("mobile-key-123abc").Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

### Initializing the client and fetching flag configuration

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The C++ (client-side) SDK uses a mobile key</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The C++ (client-side) SDK uses a mobile key. Your environment's mobile key is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects) page. To learn more about key types, read [Keys](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#keys).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you install the SDK, initialize a single shared `Client`. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key and the context for which you want to evaluate flags. The mobile key authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Mobile keys are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. However, never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here's how to configure the mobile key and define the context:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (native)">

```cpp

auto config = client_side::ConfigBuilder("mobile-key-123abc").Build();
if (!config) {
   /* an error occurred, config is not valid */
}
auto context = ContextBuilder().Kind("user", "user-key-123abc").Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (C binding)">

```c
LDClientConfigBuilder builder = LDClientConfigBuilder_New("mobile-key-123abc");

LDClientConfig config;
LDStatus status = LDClientConfigBuilder_Build(builder, &config);

if (!LDStatus_Ok(status)) {
     /* an error occurred, config is not valid */
}

LDContextBuilder context_builder = LDContextBuilder_New();
LDContextBuilder_AddKind(context_builder, "user", "user-key-123abc");

LDContext context = LDContextBuilder_Build(context_builder);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C SDK v2.x (native)">

```c
struct LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("mobile-key-123abc");
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("user-key-123abc");
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C SDK v2.x (C++ binding)">

```cpp
LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("mobile-key-123abc");
LDUser *user = LDUserNew("user-key-123abc");
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Next, construct the client and call `StartAsync` to initiate a remote call to the LaunchDarkly service and fetch the feature flag settings for a given context.

Because the client initializes asynchronously, you may choose to block until the client is ready.

To block on initialization:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (native)">

```cpp
client_side::Client client(config, context);
client.StartAsync().wait_for(std::chrono::seconds(10));
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (C binding)">

```c
LDClientSDK client = LDClientSDK_New(config, context);

unsigned int maxwait = 10 * 1000; /* 10 seconds */
LDClientSDK_Start(client, maxwait, NULL);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C SDK v2.x (native)">

```c
unsigned int maxwait = 10 * 1000; /* milliseconds */
struct LDClient *client = LDClientInit(config, user, maxwait);
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C SDK v2.x (C++ binding)">

```cpp
unsigned int maxwait = 10 * 1000; /* milliseconds */
LDClientCPP *client = LDClientCPP::Init(config, user, maxwait);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To initialize asynchronously:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (native)">

```cpp
client_side::Client client(config, context);
client.StartAsync();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (C binding)">

```c
LDClientSDK client = LDClientSDK_New(config, context);

LDClientSDK_Start(client, LD_NONBLOCKING, NULL);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Whether you block on initialization or initialize asynchronously, you can also examine the result to determine if initialization succeeded. Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (native)">

```cpp
client_side::Client client(config, context);

auto start_result = client.StartAsync();
auto status = start_result.wait_for(maxwait);
if (status == std::future_status::ready) {
    /* The client's attempt to initialize succeeded or failed in the specified amount of time. */
    if (start_result.get()) {
        /* Initialization succeeded. */
    } else {
        /* Initialization failed. */
    }
} else {
    /* The specified timeout was reached, but the client is still initializing. */
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (C binding)">

```c
LDClientSDK client = LDClientSDK_New(config, context);

bool initialized_successfully;
if (LDClientSDK_Start(client, maxwait, &initialized_successfully)) {
  /* The client's attempt to initialize succeeded or failed in the specified amount of time. */
  if (initialized_successfully) {
    /* Initialization succeeded. */
  else {
    /* Initialization failed. */
  }
} else {
   /* The specified timeout was reached, but the client is still initializing. */
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Client must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `Client` a singleton for each LaunchDarkly project. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

If you have multiple LaunchDarkly projects, you can create one `Client` for each. In this situation, the clients operate independently. For example, they do not share a single connection to LaunchDarkly.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

If you block on initialization, the initialization call blocks up to the time `maxwait`. If you request a feature flag before initialization completes, you will receive the fallback value you defined in your `variation` call.

If you want to wait indefinitely for client initialization, you can listen to status updates. To learn more, read [Monitoring SDK status](/sdk/features/monitoring).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the context will receive the fallback value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's Settings tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Now you can check which variation a specific context should receive for a certain feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (native)">

```cpp
bool show_feature = client.BoolVariation("flag-key-123abc", false);
if (show_feature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (C binding)">

```c
bool show_feature = LDClientSDK_BoolVariation(client, "flag-key-123abc", false);
if (show_feature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C SDK v2.x (native)">

```c
bool show_feature = LDBoolVariation(client, "flag-key-123abc", false);
if (show_feature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C SDK v2.x (C++ binding)">

```cpp
bool show_feature = client->boolVariation("flag-key-123abc", false);

if (show_feature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
} else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
