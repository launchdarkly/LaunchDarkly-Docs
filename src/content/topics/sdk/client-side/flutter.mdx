## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Flutter SDK, and explains how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/flutter-client-sdk) and its generated [API reference](https://launchdarkly.github.io/flutter-client-sdk/).

You can also use this SDK to clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-flutter).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly Flutter SDK is compatible with Android SDK versions 21 and higher and with iOS version 10.0 and higher. The LaunchDarkly Flutter SDK does not support other Flutter platforms.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Flutter mobile application.

First, declare a dependency on the LaunchDarkly Flutter SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="yaml"
  values={[
    { label: 'pubspec.yaml', value: 'yaml', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="yaml">

```yaml
  launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk: ^1.0.0
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Then, import the package in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
import 'package:launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk/launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk.dart';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install the SDK, initialize the single shared instance of `LDClient`. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key. This authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly. Your mobile key is available in the Projects tab of your [Account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects). Mobile keys are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

The following example shows the simplest way to create the client:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
LDConfig config = LDConfigBuilder('YOUR_MOBILE_KEY').build();
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user key')
    .email('fake@example.com')
    .build();

await LDClient.start(config, user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

This method of initializing the client lets you use the SDK as soon as it is ready to return evaluated flags.

To block until the SDK receives the most recent feature flag values, use the `LDClient.startFuture` method with `await` and an optional `timeLimit`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
LDConfig config = LDConfigBuilder('YOUR_MOBILE_KEY').build();
LDUser user = LDUserBuilder('user key')
    .email('fake@example.com')
    .build();

await LDClient.start(config, user);
await LDClient.startFuture(timeLimit: Duration(seconds: 5));
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If you have configured the SDK not to make network requests, or if the device does not have a network connection, `LDClient.startFuture` returns a `Future` that  will complete immediately to avoid blocking the application indefinitely.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's Settings tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `LDClient` to check which variation a particular user will receive for a feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
bool showFeature = await LDClient.boolVariation(flagKey, false);
if (showFeature) {
    // Application code to show the feature
}
else {
    // The code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
