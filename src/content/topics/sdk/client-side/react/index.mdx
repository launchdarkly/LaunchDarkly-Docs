LaunchDarkly has two distinct React SDKs. The React SDK works on web based React codebases, and the React Native SDK is built specifically to work on the Android and iOS mobile runtimes. To learn more about each SDK, read [React SDK](/sdk/client-side/react/react-web) and [React Native SDK](/sdk/client-side/react/react-native).

Additionally, we have a plugin for Gatsby based websites. The Gatsby plugin wraps the React SDK and makes it easier to use in a Gatsby site.
