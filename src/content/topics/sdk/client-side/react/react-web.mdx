<CalloutTitle>Version 3 of the React Web SDK replaces users with contexts</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

A context is a generalized way of referring to the people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product.

You can upgrade your SDK at any time. However, the ability to target by context, or review context instances that have encountered flags in your application, is only available for customers in the contexts Early Access Program (EAP). If you want access this feature, [join the EAP](https://launchdarkly.com/eap). If you are not part of the EAP, your application can send user contexts to LaunchDarkly and they will appear on the **Users** list.

Code samples on this page are from the two most recent SDK versions where they differ. To learn more about upgrading, read [React Web SDK 2.x to 3.0 migration guide](/sdk/client-side/react/web-migration-2-to-3).

The sample code snippets for this SDK are in JavaScript. To learn more about using TypeScript with the React SDK, read [Importing types](#importing-types) and [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The React SDK is based on the JavaScript SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The React SDK builds on LaunchDarkly's JavaScript SDK to provide a better integration for use in React applications. As a result, much of the JavaScript SDK functionality is also available for the React SDK to use. For a complete client-side JavaScript SDK reference, read [JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/javascript).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly React SDK, version 3.0 and higher, is compatible with React version 16.3.3 and higher.

The LaunchDarkly React SDK, version 2.x, is compatible with React version 16.3.0 and higher.

The LaunchDarkly React SDK offers two custom hooks. If you want to use these, then you must use React version 16.8.0 or higher. To learn more, read [Hooks](#hooks).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly React SDK in your React code.

To install the React SDK, you need your LaunchDarkly environment's client-side ID. Your client-side ID is available under **Environments** on the **Projects** tab on the [**Account settings** page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Client-side IDs are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. However, never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Install the React SDK using either `npm` or `yarn`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'Installing with yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```bash
npm install launchdarkly-react-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add launchdarkly-react-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Initializing the React SDK

After you install the dependency, your code must initialize the React SDK before it can evaluate flags. You can do this in one of two ways:

* To render your app only after SDK initialization is complete, use `await` with `asyncWithLDProvider`
* To render your app first, and then initialize the SDK and process flag updates, use `withLDProvider`

Both functions rely on React's `Context` API, which lets you access your flags from any level of your component hierarchy.

When you use `asyncWithLDProvider`, it initializes the React SDK and returns a provider which is a React component. If you use the `asyncWithLDProvider` function with `await`, the rendering of your React app is delayed until SDK initialization completes. Depending on your network conditions, this may take a couple hundred milliseconds. After initialization is complete, your flags and the LaunchDarkly client become available at the start of your React app lifecycle. This ensures that your app does not flicker due to flag changes at startup time. To learn more, read [Initializing using the `asyncWithLDProvider` function](#initializing-using-asyncwithldprovider).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Preventing flicker on page load</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Initializing with `asyncWithLDProvider` can help prevent a flicker on page load if you are using default flag values. To learn more, read [Eliminating flicker when using default flag values](/sdk/client-side/javascript/default-values).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

When you use `withLDProvider`, it initializes the underlying JavaScript SDK at `componentDidMount`. This means your flags and the LaunchDarkly client only become available after your app has mounted. Use this method if you prefer to render your app first, and then process flag updates after rendering is complete. You can also optionally defer initialization further, until after you define a context. Because your app renders before initialization, using `withLDProvider` can result in a flicker due to flag changes at startup time. To learn more, read [Initializing using the `withLDProvider` function](#initializing-using-withldprovider).

### Initializing using `asyncWithLDProvider`

The `asyncWithLDProvider` function initializes the React SDK and returns a `Context.Provider`, which is a React component. It is an asynchronous function. You must initialize `asyncWithLDProvider` at the app entry point, prior to rendering, to ensure that flags and the LaunchDarkly client are ready at the start of your React app lifecycle.

The `asyncWithLDProvider` function accepts an `AsyncProviderConfig` object, which provides configuration options for the React SDK. To learn more, read [Configuring the React SDK](#configuring-the-react-sdk). One of these configuration options is the `options` field, which lets you customize your client. To learn more, read about [Configuration](/sdk/features/config#javascript) for the JavaScript SDK.

Here's how to initialize using `asyncWithLDProvider`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="react"
  values={[
    { label: 'React Web SDK, v3.0', value: 'react', },
    { label: 'React Web SDK, v2.x', value: 'react-v2', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="react">

```js
import { asyncWithLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

(async () => {
  const LDProvider = await asyncWithLDProvider({

    context: {
      "kind": "user",
      "key": "user-key-123abc",
      "name": "Sandy Smith",
      "email": "sandy@example.com"
    },
    options: { /* ... */ }
  });

  render(
    <LDProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </LDProvider>,
    document.getElementById('reactDiv'),
  );
})();
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="react-v2">

```js
import { asyncWithLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

  const LDProvider = await asyncWithLDProvider({
    clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc',
    user: {
      "key": "user-key-123abc",
      "name": "Sandy Smith",
      "email": "sandy@example.com"
    },
    options: { /* ... */ }
  });

  render(
    <LDProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </LDProvider>,
    document.getElementById('reactDiv'),
  );
})();

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Omitting the <code>kind</code> creates a user object, not a context</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you omit the `kind` attribute when you create a context, then LaunchDarkly will assume the context kind is "user" when evaluating flags. Additionally, the SDK will assume you are working with a user object, rather than a context.

Overall, this should make your upgrade easier, because your existing code will continue to work, as long as you don't make changes to your flag configuration or [bucket users based on the "secondary" attribute](/sdk/client-side/javascript/migration-2-to-3#removing-the-secondary-attribute).

However, if you are using version 3.0 of the SDK and you are omitting the `kind` attribute, then the following caveats apply:

<ul>
<li>The fields in your user object must be <code>LDUser</code> fields, not <code>LDContext</code> fields. For example, to mark an attribute as private, you must use <code>privateAttributeNames</code> in the user object, not <code>_meta.privateAttributes</code> as you would for a context object. To learn more, read <a href="/sdk/client-side/javascript/migration-2-to-3#understanding-changes-to-private-attributes">Understanding changes to private attributes</a>.</li>
<li>Any additional attributes in your user object need to be inside the <code>custom</code> property of the <code>LDUser</code>, not at the top-level as they would in a context object. To learn more, read <a href="/sdk/client-side/javascript/migration-2-to-3#working-with-built-in-and-custom-attributes">Working with built-in and custom attributes</a>.</li>
</ul>

We strongly recommend upgrading your SDK to take advantage of the context functionality.
</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After initialization is complete, your flags and the client are available at the start of your React app lifecycle. This ensures your app does not flicker due to flag changes at startup time.

If your app does not yet have the context when you call `asyncWithLDProvider`, you can omit the `context` option. This instantiates the client without explicitly specifying a context. Instead, the React SDK uses an anonymous context. Later, when you have the context, you can call `identify`.

Here's how to identify the context after initialization:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="app"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript: app.js', value: 'app', },
    { label: 'JavaScript: index.js', value: 'index', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="app">

```js
// app.js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useFlags, useLDClient } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

export default function App {
  const flags = useFlags();
  const ldClient = useLDClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    ldClient.identify({ key: 'context-key-123abc' });
  }, []);

  return <div>Let your feature flags fly!</div>
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="index">

```js
// index.js
import React from 'react';

  const LDProvider = await asyncWithLDProvider({ clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc' });

  ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <LDProvider>
        <App />
      </LDProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  )
}

renderApp();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more, read [Identifying and changing contexts](/sdk/features/identify#react).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>This function requires React 16.8.0 or later</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The `asyncWithLDProvider` function uses the Hooks API, which requires React version 16.8.0 or later.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

### Initializing using `withLDProvider`

The `withLDProvider` function initializes the React SDK and wraps your root component in a `Context.Provider`, which is a React component.

The `withLDProvider` function accepts a `ProviderConfig` object, which provides configuration properties for the React SDK. In the example below, the `context` property is specified. Alternatively, you could set the `deferInitialization` property, and defer initialization until after you define the context property. To learn more, read [Configuring the React SDK](#configuring-the-react-sdk). Another of these configuration properties is the `options` field, which lets you customize your client. To learn more, read about [Configuration](/sdk/features/config#javascript) for the JavaScript SDK.

Here's how to initialize using `withLDProvider`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="react"
  values={[
    { label: 'React Web SDK, v3.0', value: 'react', },
    { label: 'React Web SDK, v2.x', value: 'react-v2', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="react">

```js
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { withLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

import App from './App';

const LDProvider = withLDProvider({
  clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc',
  context: {
    "kind": "user",
    "key": "user-key-123abc",
    "name": "Sandy Smith",
    "email": "sandy@example.com"
  },
  options: { /* ... */ }
})(App);

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
render(<LDProvider />, rootElement);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="react-v2">

```js
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { withLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

import App from './App';

const LDProvider = withLDProvider({
  clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc',
  user: {
    "key": "user-key-123abc",
    "name": "Sandy Smith",
    "email": "sandy@example.com"
  },
  options: { /* ... */ }
})(App);

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
render(<LDProvider />, rootElement);

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After initialization is complete, your flags and the client are only available after your app has mounted. Use this method if you prefer to render your app first, and then process flag updates after rendering is complete.

### Subscribing to flag changes

The React SDK automatically subscribes to flag `change` events after your app has mounted, which opens a streaming connection. We recommend explicitly enabling streaming mode. To enable streaming mode, specify a `streaming: true` attribute in your `options` object. When streaming is disabled, no live updates occur.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the context will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's **Settings** tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox in your project [**Settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This behavior is different from the JavaScript SDK, where you need to opt in to event listening. To learn more about how the JavaScript SDK handles flag change events, read [Subscribing to flag changes](/sdk/features/flag-changes#javascript).

## Using `withLDConsumer`

After your code has initialized the React SDK, use `withLDConsumer` to access flag values and the LaunchDarkly client. The return value of `withLDConsumer` is a wrapper function that takes your component and returns a React component injected with `flags` and `ldClient` as props.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import { withLDConsumer } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

const Home = ({ flags, ldClient /*, ...otherProps */ }) => {
  // You can call any of the methods from the JavaScript SDK
  // ldClient.identify({...})

  return flags.devTestFlag ? <div>Flag on</div> : <div>Flag off</div>;
};

export default withLDConsumer()(Home);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Configuring the React SDK

The [`AsyncProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/index.html#asyncwithldprovider) object specifies configuration for the `asyncWithLDProvider` function and the [`ProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/interfaces/ProviderConfig.html) object specifies configuration for the `withLDProvider` function.

The only difference between `AsyncProviderConfig` and `ProviderConfig` is that `AsyncProviderConfig` does not have the `deferInitialization` property, because `asyncWithLDProvider` cannot be deferred. You must initialize `asyncWithLDProvider` at the app entry point prior to rendering to ensure flags and the client are ready at the start of your React app lifecycle.

The only mandatory property is the client-side ID. All other properties are optional.

These are the properties:

- `clientSideID`: This is your project and environment specific client-side ID. This property is mandatory.
- `context`: A LaunchDarkly [context](/home/contexts) object. This property is optional unless you are initializing in secure mode, in which case it is mandatory. Defaults to an anonymous user.
- `options`: The LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK initialization [options](/sdk/features/config#javascript). This property is optional.
- `reactOptions`: This property is specific to the React SDK. You can use this option to [disable automatic camel casing](#flag-keys) of flag keys when using the React SDK, or to [disable evaluation events on read](#events). This property is optional.
- `deferInitialization`: This property allows you to defer SDK initialization until you define the `context` property. This property is optional, and is only available in `ProviderConfig`, when you initialize using `withLDProvider`.

  By deferring SDK initialization, you defer all steps which take place as part of SDK initialization, including reading flag values from local storage and sending the SDK's `ready` event.

  However, even if you defer SDK initialization, the SDK continues to load bootstrapped flag values as long as you provide the bootstrapped values as a map of flag keys and values. If you indicate that the SDK should bootstrap flags from local storage, this will not happen until the SDK initializes.

- `flags`: A map of flag keys and default values. If you specify this property, the React SDK will only subscribe to updates to these flags. If you do not specify this property, the React SDK subscribes to all flags. This property is optional.

  Specify the `flags` property as a map of flag keys and values. The flag keys must be in their original form as known to LaunchDarkly, rather than in their camel-cased form. The React SDK passes each flag's value to the underlying `variation` call as the default value to use in case of an error. To learn more, read [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating#javascript) for the JavaScript SDK.

The following is an example `ProviderConfig` object including each of the above properties:

<CodeTabs
defaultValue="react"
values={[
  { label: 'React Web SDK, v3.0', value: 'react', },
  { label: 'React Web SDK, v2.x', value: 'react-v2', },
]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="react">

```js
{
  clientSideID: "client-side-id-123abc",
  context: {
    kind: "user",
    key: "user-key-123abc",
    name: "Sandy Smith",
    email: "sandy@example.com"
  },
  options: {
    bootstrap: "localStorage"
  },
  reactOptions: {
    useCamelCaseFlagKeys: false
  },
  deferInitialization: false,
  flags: {
    "bool-flag-key-123abc": true,
    "numeric-flag-key-123abc": 5
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="react-v2">

```js
{
  clientSideID: "client-side-id-123abc",
  user: {
    key: "user-key-123abc",
    name: "Sandy Smith",
    email: "sandy@example.com"
  },
  options: {
    bootstrap: "localStorage"
  },
  reactOptions: {
    useCamelCaseFlagKeys: false
  },
  deferInitialization: false,

    "bool-flag-key-123abc": true,
    "numeric-flag-key-123abc": 5
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Hooks

The React SDK offers two custom hooks which you can use as an alternative to `withLDConsumer`: `useFlags` and `useLDClient`.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>These functions require React 16.8.0 or later</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Both `useFlags` and `useLDClient` use the Hooks API, which requires React version 16.8.0 or later.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

`useFlags` is a custom hook which returns all feature flags. It uses the `useContext` primitive to access the LaunchDarkly context set up by `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider`. You still must use the `asyncWithLDProvider` or the `withLDProvider` higher-order component at the root of your application to initialize the React SDK and populate the context with the client and your flags.

`useLDClient` is a custom hook which returns the underlying LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK client object. Like the `useFlags` custom hook, `useLDClient` also uses the `useContext` primitive to access the LaunchDarkly context set up by `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider`. You still must use the `asyncWithLDProvider` or the `withLDProvider` higher-order component to initialize the React SDK to use this custom hook.

For an example of how to use a custom hook, read [HooksDemo](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/master/examples/hoc/src/universal/hooksDemo.js).

## Flag keys

LaunchDarkly primarily identifies feature flags by a key which must contain only alphanumeric characters, dots (`.`), underscores (`_`), and dashes (`-`). These keys are used in the SDKs to identify flags, and in LaunchDarkly's [REST API](/home/connecting/api).

However, in JavaScript, accessing keys containing `.` and `-` requires the bracket operator. Instead of requiring this, the React SDK automatically changes all flag keys to camel case by default. A flag with key `dev-flag-test` is accessible as `flags.devFlagTest`.

Automatically changing flag keys to camel case poses some problems:

* It is possible to induce a key collision if there are multiple LaunchDarkly flag keys which resolve to the same camel-case key. For example, `dev-flag-test` and `dev.flag.test` are unique keys in LaunchDarkly, but the React SDK changes them to the same camel-case key.
* If a flag key contains three or more capital letters in a row, the React SDK automatically converts all letters between the first and last capital letter to lower case. For example, the React SDK converts a flag with the key `devQAFlagTest` to `devQaFlagTest`. If you use `devQAFlagTest` with the `useFlags()` hook, the React SDK will not find the flag.
* LaunchDarkly's [code references](/home/code/code-references) tool expects your source code to reference the exact key, not a camel-case equivalent. The tool does not detect keys that were automatically changed to camel-case. However, you can configure an alias to ensure that the code references tool detects the camel-case equivalents. To learn more, read [Finding flag aliases](/home/code/code-references#finding-flag-aliases).
* Because the camel-case functionality is implemented in the React SDK instead of in the underlying JavaScript SDK, the underlying `client` object and functionality provided by the JavaScript SDK reflect flag keys in their original format. Only React-specific contexts such as your injected props use camel case.

To disable the React SDK's automatic camel-case feature, provide `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider` with the `reactOptions.useCamelCaseFlagKeys` property. The React SDK supports this in versions 2.13.0 and later.

Here's how to configure the automatic camel-case feature:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
export default withLDProvider({
  clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc',
  reactOptions: {
    useCamelCaseFlagKeys: false
  }
})(App);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

With this configuration option in place, you can access your `dev-flag-test` flag using bracket notation, for example, `flag['dev-flag-test']`.

If you enable the automatic camel-case feature and you want to use LaunchDarkly's code references tool, you can configure [alias](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/main/docs/ALIASES.md#configuring-aliases) support to find camel-cased flags. To do so, use the value `camelCase` for the alias settings.

## Example app

Run this [example](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/tree/master/examples/hoc) for a fully working single page app with React and react-router. You must enter your `clientSideId` in the [client root app file](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/master/examples/hoc/src/universal/app.js) and create a flag with key `dev-test-flag` in your flags list before running the example.

## Importing types

In addition to its own bundled types, the React SDK uses types from `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`. If you use Typescript and you need to use `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` types, you can install the `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` package as a dev dependency. You can then import the types you want directly from `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`.

If you are using the React SDK within a React application that uses TypeScript, you may encounter some compiler errors or warnings initially. One solution is to wrap your component in a `withLDProvider` function, and then coerce your component to type `<ComponentType<{}>`. To learn how, read [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).

If you use eslint, the SDK requires that you add `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` as a dev dependency. Otherwise, eslint will report a `no-extraneous-dependencies` error.

## Events

The React SDK (version 2.27 and later) sends flag evaluation events only when a context receives a flag evaluation, not when `allFlags` is called. The React SDK calls the JavaScript SDK's `allFlags` method on load to cache flag values. It uses the JavaScript SDK's `sendEventsOnlyForVariation` option, set to `true`, to prevent `allFlags` from sending evaluation events for every flag.

Versions 2.26 and earlier of the React SDK send an evaluation event when a user reads a flag evaluation using `allFlags` and `variation`. To recreate this behavior in version 2.27 and later, explicitly set `options.sendEventsOnlyForVariation: false` and set `reactOptions.sendEventsOnFlagRead: false`. Version 3 only sends events when a context receives a flag evaluation.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Experimentation events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Setting `reactOptions.sendEventsOnFlagRead: false` could prevent experimentation events from recording correctly. Always confirm that this option is disabled when troubleshooting experiments.
  
</CalloutDescription>
