  <CalloutTitle>The React SDK does not work in React Native projects</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you want to add LaunchDarkly to your React Native codebase, use the React Native SDK instead. The React SDK is intended for use in web applications, and the React Native SDK is specifically designed to run in mobile environments. To learn more, read [React Native SDK](/sdk/client-side/react/react-native).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the client-side React SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source — head to the [React SDK code](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk) in the JavaScript SDK GitHub repository. The online [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. You can also clone and run a [sample application](/sdk/client-side/react#example-app) using this SDK.


You can use LaunchDarkly in a Gatsby application with our [Gatsby plugin](/sdk/client-side/react/gatsby).

<Callout intent="info">
  <CalloutTitle>The React SDK is based on the JavaScript SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>


The React SDK builds on LaunchDarkly's JavaScript SDK to provide a better integration for use in React applications. As a result, much of the JavaScript SDK functionality is also available for the React SDK to use. For a complete client-side JavaScript SDK reference, read [JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/javascript).

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>This SDK requires React 16.3.0 or later</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>


This SDK uses the Context API, which requires React version 16.3.0 or later. You must use a newer
version if you want to use the Hooks API as well. To learn more, read [Hooks](#hooks).


</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your React code.

To install the React SDK, you need your LaunchDarkly environment's client-side ID, which is available in LaunchDarkly's [**Account Settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). Client-side IDs are not secret. You can expose them in your client-side code with no risk.

To begin using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your React code:

1. Use either `npm` or `yarn` to install the React SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'Installing with yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```bash
npm i --save launchdarkly-react-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add launchdarkly-react-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

2. After you install the dependency, initialize the React SDK. You can initialize the React SDK in one of two ways:

- Using the `asyncWithLDProvider` function
- Using the `withLDProvider` function

Both rely on React's `Context` API which lets you access your flags from any level of your component hierarchy. Both functions accept a [`ProviderConfig`](/sdk/client-side/react#configuring-the-react-sdk) object used to configure the React SDK.

## `asyncWithLDProvider`

The `asyncWithLDProvider` function initializes the React SDK and returns a provider which is a React component. It is an async function.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import { asyncWithLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

(async () => {
  const LDProvider = await asyncWithLDProvider({
    clientSideID: 'your-client-side-id',
    user: {
      "key": "aa0ceb",
      "name": "Grace Hopper",
      "email": "gracehopper@example.com"
    },
    options: { /* ... */ }
  });

  render(
    <LDProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </LDProvider>,
    document.getElementById('reactDiv'),
  );
})();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After initialization is complete, your flags and the ldClient become available at the start of your React app lifecycle. This ensures your app does not flicker due to flag changes at startup time.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Rendering may be delayed</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>


Because the `asyncWithLDProvider` function is asynchronous, the rendering of your React app is delayed until initialization is completed. This can take up to 200 milliseconds, but often completes sooner. Alternatively, you can use the [`withLDProvider`](/sdk/client-side/react#withldprovider) function if you prefer to render your app first and then process flag updates after rendering is complete.


</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>
<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>This function requires React 16.8.0 or later</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>


The `asyncWithLDProvider` function uses the Hooks API, which requires React version 16.8.0 or later.


</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## `withLDProvider`

The `withLDProvider` function initializes the React SDK and wraps your root component in a `Context.Provider`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import { withLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

export default withLDProvider({
  clientSideID: 'your-client-side-id',
  user: {
    "key": "aa0ceb",
    "name": "Grace Hopper",
    "email": "gracehopper@example.com"
  },
  options: { /* ... */ }
})(YourApp);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Customize your client from the `options` field. To learn more, read the [JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/javascript#customizing-your-client).

The React SDK automatically subscribes to flag change events. This is different from the JavaScript SDK, where customers need to opt in to event listening. To learn more, read [JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/javascript#subscribing-to-feature-flag-changes).

In the React SDK streaming mode is enabled by default. To disable streaming mode, specify a `streaming: false` attribute in your `options` object.

## `withLDConsumer`

The return value of `withLDConsumer` is a wrapper function that takes your component and returns a React component injected with `flags` & `ldClient` as props.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import { withLDConsumer } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

const Home = ({ flags, ldClient /*, ...otherProps */ }) => {
  // You can call any of the methods from the JavaScript SDK
  // ldClient.identify({...})

  return flags.devTestFlag ? <div>Flag on</div> : <div>Flag off</div>;
};

export default withLDConsumer()(Home);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Configuring the React SDK

The [`ProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/interfaces/providerconfig.html) object configures the React SDK. The only mandatory property is the client-side ID. All other properties are optional.

- `clientSideID`: This is your project and environment specific client-side ID. This property is mandatory.

- `user`: A LaunchDarkly [user](/sdk/features/user-config) object. This property is optional unless you are initializing in secure mode, in which case it is mandatory.

- `options`: LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK initialization [options](/sdk/features/config). This property is optional.

- `reactOptions`: This property is specific to the React SDK. You can use this option to [disable automatic camel casing](/sdk/client-side/react#flag-keys) of flag keys when using the React SDK. This property is optional.

- `deferInitialization`: This property allows SDK initialization to be deferred until the `user` property is defined.

  By deferring SDK initialization, you defer all steps which take place as part of SDK initialization, including reading flag values from local storage and sending the SDK's `ready` event.

  The one exception to this rule is that the SDK continues to load bootstrapped flag values as long as the bootstrapped values are provided as a map of flag keys and values. As mentioned above, if indicated that the SDK should bootstrap flags from local storage, this will not happen until the SDK initializes.

- `flags`: If specified, the React SDK will only subscribe for updates to these flags. When this property is unspecified, the React SDK subscribes to all flags. This property is optional.

  Specify the `flags` property as a map of flag keys and values. The flag keys must be in their original form (as known to LaunchDarkly) rather than in their camel-cased form. Each flag's value is passed along to the resulting JS SDK [`variation`](/sdk/features/variation) invocation and used as the flag's default value in the case of an error.

The following is an example `ProviderConfig` object including each of the above properties:

<CodeTabs
defaultValue="js"
values={[
  { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
{
  clientSideID: "your-client-side-id",
  user: {
    key: "aa0ceb",
    name: "Grace Hopper",
    email: "gracehopper@example.com"
  },
  options: {
    bootstrap: "localStorage"
  },
  reactOptions: {
    useCamelCaseFlagKeys: false
  },
  deferInitialization: false,
  flags: {
    "my-bool-flag": true,
    "my-int-flag": 5
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Hooks

The React SDK offers two custom hooks which you can use as an alternative to `withLDConsumer`: `useFlags` and `useLDClient`.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>These functions require React 16.8.0 or later</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

`useFlags` and `useLDClient` use the Hooks API, which requires React version 16.8.0 or later.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

`useFlags` is a custom hook which returns all feature flags. It uses the useContext primitive to access the LaunchDarkly context set up by `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider`. You still must use the `asyncWithLDProvider` or the `withLDProvider` higher-order component at the root of your application to initialize the React SDK and populate the context with `LDClient` and your flags.

`useLDClient` is the second custom hook which returns the underlying LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK client object. Like the `useFlags` custom hook, `useLDClient` also uses the useContext primitive to access the LaunchDarkly context set up by `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider`. You still must use the `asyncWithLDProvider` or the `withLDProvider` higher-order component to initialize the React SDK to use this custom hook.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useFlags, useLDClient } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

const HooksDemo = () => {
  const { devTestFlag } = useFlags();
  const ldClient = useLDClient();

  const onLoginSuccessful = () => ldClient.identify({ key: 'aa0ceb' });

  return (
    <div>{devTestFlag ? 'Flag on' : 'Flag off'}</div>
  );
};

export default HooksDemo;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Flag keys

LaunchDarkly primarily identifies feature flags by a key which must contain only alphanumeric characters, dots (`.`), underscores (`_`), and dashes (`-`). These keys are used across all of LaunchDarkly's APIs as well as in the SDKs to identify flags.

However, JavaScript and React cannot access keys with a dot notation, so the React SDK automatically changes all flag keys to camel case. A flag with key `dev-flag-test` is accessible as `flags.devFlagTest`.

Automatically changing flag keys to camel case poses some problems:

1. It is possible to induce a key collision if there are multiple LaunchDarkly flag keys which resolve to the same camel-case key. For example, `dev-flag-test` and `dev.flag.test` are unique keys in LaunchDarkly, but the React SDK changes them to the same camel-case key.
2. If a flag key contains three or more capital letters in a row, the SDK automatically converts all letters between the first and last capital letter to lower case. For example, the SDK converts a flag with the key `devQAFlagTest` to `devQaFlagTest`. If you use `devQAFlagTest` with the `useFlags()` hook, the SDK does not find the flag.
3. LaunchDarkly's [code references](/integrations/code-references) tool expects your source code to reference the exact key, not a camel-case equivalent. The tool does not detect keys that were automatically changed to camel-case.
4. Because the camel-case functionality is implemented in the React SDK instead of in the underlying JavaScript SDK, the underlying `ldClient` object and functionality provided by the JavaScript SDK reflect flag keys in their original format. Only React-specific contexts such as your injected props use camel case.

To disable the SDK's automatic camel-case feature, provide `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider` with the `reactOptions.useCamelCaseFlagKeys` property as shown in the following example. This is supported in versions 2.13.0 and later of the React SDK.

If the automatic camel-case feature is enabled and you want to use LaunchDarkly's code references tool, you can configure [alias](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/master/docs/ALIASES.md#configuring-aliases) support to find camel-cased flags. To do so, use the value `camelCase` for the alias settings.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
export default withLDProvider({
  clientSideID: 'your-client-side-id',
  reactOptions: {
    useCamelCaseFlagKeys: false
  }
})(App);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

With this configuration option in place, you would now access your `dev-flag-test` flag using bracket notation. For example, `flag['dev-flag-test']`.

<Callout intent="alert">
  <CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
  <CalloutDescription>

  You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the flags can be evaluated. If you evaluate a feature flag that is not available, you receive the default value for that flag. If you want a project's flags to be made available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Example app

Check the [example](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/tree/master/examples/hoc) for a fully working single page app with React and react-router. You must enter your `clientSideId` in the [client root app file](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/master/examples/hoc/src/universal/app.js) and create a flag with key `dev-test-flag` in your dashboard before running the example.
