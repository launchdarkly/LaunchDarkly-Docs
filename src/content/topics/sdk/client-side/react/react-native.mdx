## Overview

This topic documents how to get started with the React Native SDK, and links to reference information on all of the supported features.

<CalloutTitle>SDK quick links</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. In addition to this reference guide, we provide source, API reference documentation, and sample applications:

The sample code snippets for this SDK are available in both JavaScript and TypeScript, where the sample code differs. To learn more, read [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly React Native SDK is compatible with Xcode 12.2 or higher and React Native 0.64 or higher.

If you need support for earlier versions of React Native, use older versions of the LaunchDarkly React Native SDK. To learn more, read [Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-native-client-sdk/releases).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

<Callout intent="warning">
<CalloutTitle>Expo usage</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly React Native client-side SDK is not compatible with the Expo managed workflow because the SDK uses native modules. Consider using the [bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/exploring-bare-workflow/) instead.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your React Native code.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency. Add the LaunchDarkly npm dependency to your project and link it to your React Native project.

To add the LaunchDarkly npm dependency:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```bash
npm install --save launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk
npx pod-install
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You must have a `Podfile` in your `ios/` directory. After you write the `Podfile`, run `pod install` in the `ios/` directory. This SDK requires Xcode 12.2 or higher and compiles against Swift 5.

After setting up the SDK, import the SDK into your project:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import LDClient from 'launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk';
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
import LDClient, * as ld from 'launchdarkly-react-native-client-sdk';
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After the SDK is imported, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`, passing in the client and user configuration objects. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key. This authorizes your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly. Your mobile key is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects) page. Mobile keys are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The following example shows the simplest way to create a shared instance of `LDClient`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let client = new LDClient();
let config = { mobileKey: 'YOUR_MOBILE_KEY' };
let user = { key: 'user_key' };

await client.configure(config, user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem>

```ts
let client = new LDClient();
let config: ld.LDConfig = { mobileKey: 'YOUR_MOBILE_KEY' };
let user: ld.LDUser = { key: 'user_key' };

await client.configure(config, user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can give `.configure` a timeout parameter. If it receives flag values before the timeout, the returned promise will resolve. Otherwise, it will be rejected.

Here is an example with a timeout of five seconds:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let client = new LDClient();
let config = { mobileKey: 'YOUR_MOBILE_KEY' };
let user = { key: 'user_key' };

client.configure(config, user, 5.0)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem>

```ts
let client = new LDClient();
let config: ld.LDConfig = { mobileKey: 'YOUR_MOBILE_KEY' };
let user: ld.LDUser = { key: 'user_key' };

client.configure(config, user, 5.0);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to mobile SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's **Settings** tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [**Settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

## Background fetch

The React Native SDK defaults to the background fetch behavior for the platform it's running on.

## Shutting down

Shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#react-native).

## Data collection

To learn more about data collection within this SDK and implications on submissions to the Apple App Store, read [Apple App Store data collection policy](/sdk/concepts/apple-app-store).
