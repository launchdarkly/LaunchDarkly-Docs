## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Xamarin SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [Xamarin SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/xamarin-client-sdk). Additionally you can clone and run sample applications using this SDK with [Xamarin](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-xamarin), and [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-xamarin-forms). The [online API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/) contain the programmatic definitions of every type, property, and method.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in mobile, desktop, and embedded client applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in *single-user* mobile, desktop, and embedded applications. If you have a .NET application and are looking to set up LaunchDarkly on the server-side, head to our [.NET SDK reference](/sdk/server-side/dotnet).

To learn more, read [client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Xamarin application.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Requirements</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The Xamarin SDK natively supports Android (version 7.1 or higher) or iOS (version 10 or higher); it can also be used on any other platform that supports .NET Standard (version 1.6 or higher), although the .NET Standard version lacks some mobile-specific features such as detecting network connectivity. Previous beta releases of the SDK used the Xamarin.Essentials library, but it no longer has the dependency.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To start using the Xamarin SDK:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
Install-Package LaunchDarkly.XamarinSdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly packages in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
using LaunchDarkly.Client;
using LaunchDarkly.Xamarin;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After the dependency is installed, initialize the LaunchDarkly client. Create a single, shared instance of `LdClient`. This authorizes your application to connect to LaunchDarkly and retrieve flag values for your application and environment. To create a client instance, you need your environment's mobile key, available in the Projects tab of your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). Be sure to use a mobile key. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a mobile application.

The following example shows the simplest way to create the client. It will block for up to one second until the latest feature flags have been retrieved from LaunchDarkly.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
var user = User.WithKey(user_key);
var timeSpan = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
client = LdClient.Init("MY_MOBILE_KEY", user, timeSpan);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

However, calling blocking code from the main thread in an Android app is not considered a best practice. The preferred method, loading the client asynchronously, is shown here:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
User user = User.WithKey(user_key);
client = await LdClient.InitAsync("MY_MOBILE_KEY", user);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LdClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make LdClient a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows us to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. **Be sure that you're not instantiating a new client with every request.**

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Android requires AccessNetworkState permission</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

For Android, the `AccessNetworkState` permission is required and must be configured in the Android project. To learn more, read the [Xamarin docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/essentials/connectivity?context=xamarin%2Fios&tabs=android) about how to implement this requirement.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using `client`, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag. Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
bool showFeature = client.BoolVariation("your.feature.key", false);
if (showFeature) {
    // application code to show the feature
}
else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the flags can be evaluated. If you evaluate a feature flag that is not available, you receive the default value for that flag. If you want a project's flags to be made available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Using the Relay Proxy

You can configure the Xamarin SDK to connect to the [Relay Proxy](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay) as follows:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
Configuration config = Configuration.Builder("YOUR_SDK_KEY")
    .StreamUri(new URI("YOUR_RELAY_URI"))
    .Build();
LdClient client = LdClient.Init(config);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#xamarin).
