<CalloutTitle>Swift and Objective-C compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This documentation is for the latest version of the LaunchDarkly SDK for iOS.

SDK versions 4.0.0 and later are written in Swift. These versions are compatible with applications written in either Swift or Objective-C. See inline code samples throughout the documentation for use with either language.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the iOS SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in the [iOS SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk/tree/v5) or the generated [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/ios-client-sdk/). You can also clone and run sample applications using this SDK with [iOS](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-ios-swift), [macOS](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-macos), and [tvOS](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-tvos).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your application.

### Including the SDK as a dependency

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application. LaunchDarkly supports multiple methods for installing the SDK in your application.

#### Swift Package Manager
---
<br/>

If you use the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), you can install the SDK through Xcode or include it as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file.

To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency` and enter the [iOS SDK repository URL](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk) clone URL, then select your desired version constraints.

Including the SDK as a dependency in a `Package.swift` file looks like this:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Package.swift', value: 'swift', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
//...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk.git", .upToNextMinor("5.4.0")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YOUR_TARGET",
            dependencies: ["LaunchDarkly"]
        )
    ],
//...
```
</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### CocoaPods
---
<br/>

If you use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), you can install the SDK by adding the following to your `Podfile`. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version.

Here is the code to add to your `Podfile`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    { label: 'Podfile', value: 'ruby', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="ruby">

```ruby
use_frameworks!
target 'YourTargetName' do
  pod 'LaunchDarkly', '~> 5.4'
end
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Carthage
---
<br/>

If you use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), you can install the SDK by specifying it in your `Cartfile`. Again, refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version.

Here is the code to include in your `Cartfile`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Cartfile', value: 'swift', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
github "launchdarkly/ios-client" ~> 5.4
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Installing the SDK manually
---
<br/>

Refer to the [SDK readme](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ios-client-sdk/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on installing the SDK without CocoaPods or Carthage.

### Using the SDK in your application

This is a brief overview of using the SDK, see the detailed sections below for more information on configuration and advanced features.

#### Importing
---
<br/>

First import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
import LaunchDarkly
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
@import LaunchDarkly;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Initializing the SDK
---
<br/>

Now that the SDK is imported, configure and initialize it. Specify your *mobile key* when configuring the SDK so that your application is authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly, retrieve flags for your environment, and report events. Your mobile key is available in the Projects tab of your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). Be sure to use a mobile key. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a mobile application.

Here is how to specify your mobile key:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
let config = LDConfig(mobileKey: "YOUR_MOBILE_KEY")
let user = LDUser(key: "test-user")

LDClient.start(config: config, user: user)

// If you need to ensure that the most recent flags have been received
// start supports an optional completion that is triggered when the SDK
// has retrieved flags for the configured user.
LDClient.start(config: config, user: user) {
    // Client has received flags for the user
}

// If you would like the completion to be called even in cases where
// the SDK is unable to retrieve flags for the user, there is a variant
// to the start method that takes a maximum time to wait for flag values.
// This variant notifies the completion whether the operation timed out.
LDClient.start(config: config, user: user, startWaitSeconds: 5) { timedOut in
    if timedOut {
        // The SDK may not have the most recent flags for the configured user
    } else {
        // The SDK has received flags for the configured user
    }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
LDConfig *config = [[LDConfig alloc] initWithMobileKey:@"YOUR_MOBILE_KEY"];
LDUser *user = [[LDUser alloc] initWithKey:@"test-user"];

[LDClient startWithConfiguration:config user:user]
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Retrieving the client instance
---
<br/>

After calling `start`, the `LDClient` instance can be retrieved with the static method `LDClient.get()`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
let client = LDClient.get()!
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
LDClient *client = [LDClient get];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

#### Getting the variation to serve the configured user
---
<br/>
<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the flags can be evaluated. If you evaluate a feature flag that is not available, you receive the default value for that flag. If you want a project's flags to be made available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Mobile key** checkbox in your project [Settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using the `LDClient` instance, you can check which variation the configured user should receive for a given feature flag:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
let showFeature = client.variation(forKey: "flag-key", defaultValue: false)

if showFeature {
  // application code to show the feature
else {
  // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
BOOL showFeature = [client boolVariationForKey:@"flag-key" defaultValue:NO];
if (showFeature) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Background fetch

When the app is backgrounded, the SDK does not receive real-time events. However, MacOS supports background fetch which updates flag values opportunistically, according to iOS standard defaults. iOS does not support background fetch.

To change the  background fetch interval for flags in your app, add the following code in your `LDConfig`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
var ldConfig = LDConfig(mobileKey: "MY_MOBILE_KEY")
ldConfig.backgroundFlagPollingInterval = 3600
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
LDConfig *config = [[LDConfig alloc] initWithMobileKey:@"YOUR_MOBILE_KEY"];
config.backgroundFlagPollingInterval = 3600
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#ios).
