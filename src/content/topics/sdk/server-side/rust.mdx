## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Rust SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in the [Rust SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/rust-server-sdk). The online [Rust API docs](https://docs.rs/launchdarkly-server-sdk) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. You can also try this SDK out by cloning and running a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-rust).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Rust application.

First, install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="rust"
  values={[
    { label: 'Shell', value: 'rust', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="rust">

```bash
cargo install cargo-edit
cargo add launchdarkly-server-sdk --allow-prerelease
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Next, import the LaunchDarkly client in your application code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="rust"
  values={[
    { label: 'Rust', value: 'rust', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="rust">

```rust
use launchdarkly_server_sdk::{Client, ConfigBuilder, User};
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of the LaunchDarkly client. Specify your SDK key here so that your application is authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly, your application, and your environment.

Once you have created the client, start the client process and wait for the client to initialize. This SDK depends on the tokio crate to provide a default runtime and as such it is a required dependency.

Only create one instance of `client`.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="rust"
  values={[
    { label: 'Rust', value: 'rust', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="rust">

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main () {
    let config = ConfigBuilder::new(&sdk_key).build();
    let client = Client::build(config).unwrap();

    client.start_with_default_executor();

    if !client.initialized_async().await {
        panic!("Client failed to successfully initialize");
    }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>client must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `client` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `client` to check which variation a particular user will receive for a given feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="rust"
  values={[
    { label: 'Rust', value: 'rust', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="rust">

```rust
let user = User::with_key("user@test.com").build();
let show_feature = client.bool_variation(&user, "your.flag.key", false);

if show_feature {
  # application code to show the feature
} else {
  # the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
