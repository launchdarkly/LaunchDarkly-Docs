## Overview

This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the server-side C/C++ SDK, and explains how these methods work. LaunchDarkly's SDKs are open source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-server-sdk) and its generated [API reference](https://launchdarkly.github.io/c-server-sdk).

You can also use this SDK to clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-c-server).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>For use in server-side applications only</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This SDK is intended for use in multi-user C/C++ server applications. If you have a C/C++ application and want to set up LaunchDarkly in a mobile, desktop, or embedded application, read the [client-side C/C++ SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/c-c--).

To learn more about LaunchDarkly's different SDK types, read [Client-side and server-side SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side).

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting Started process](/home/getting-started), follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your C application.

Unlike other LaunchDarkly SDKs, the C/C++ SDK has no installation steps. To get started, clone [this repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-server-sdk) or download a release archive from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/c-server-sdk/releases) page. You can use `CMakeLists.txt` in this repository as a starting point for integrating this SDK into your application.

After cloning the repository, include the LaunchDarkly SDK headers:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
#include "launchdarkly/api.h"
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Configure logging, and call the global initialization function. You must call these functions before you perform any other operations. LaunchDarkly provides a predefined convenience logger.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDConfigureGlobalLogger(LD_LOG_INFO, LDBasicLogger);
LDGlobalInit();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install and import the SDK, create a single, shared instance of `LDClient`. Specify your SDK key here to authorize your application to connect to a particular environment within LaunchDarkly.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Calling `LDClientInit` initiates a remote call to the LaunchDarkly service to fetch feature flags. This call blocks up to the time defined by `maxwaitmilliseconds`. If you request a feature flag before the client has completed initialization, you will receive the default flag value.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
unsigned int maxwaitmilliseconds = 10 * 1000;
struct LDConfig *config = LDConfigNew("YOUR_SDK_KEY");
struct LDUser *user = LDUserNew("YOUR_USER_KEY");
struct LDClient *client = LDClientInit(config, maxwaitmilliseconds);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make `LDClient` a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows LaunchDarkly to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. Do not instantiate a new client with every request.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

You can use `client` to check which variation a particular user will receive for a given feature flag.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
show_feature = LDBoolVariation(client, user, "your.flag.key", false);
if (show_feature) {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

If the SDK might be able to execute your flag evaluation before `client` initializes, wrap your call in `LDClientIsInitialized(client)`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
if (LDClientIsInitialized(client)) {
    // flag evaluation goes here
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Shutting down

Lastly, shut down the client when your application terminates. To learn more, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown#cc-server-side).
