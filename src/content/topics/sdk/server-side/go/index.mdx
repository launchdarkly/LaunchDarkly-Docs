This reference guide documents all of the methods available in the Go SDK, and explains in detail how these methods work. If you want to dig even deeper, our SDKs are open source. To learn more, read [Go SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk). The online [Go API docs](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5) contain the programmatic definitions of every type and method. Additionally you can clone and run a [sample application](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-go) using this SDK.

## Getting started

Building on top of our [Getting Started guide](/home/getting-started), the following steps will get you started with using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your Go application.

The first step is to install the LaunchDarkly SDK as a dependency in your application. How you do this depends on what dependency management system you are using:

* For the standard [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) system, you can simply import the SDK packages in your code and `go build` will automatically download them. The SDK and its dependencies are modules.
* If you are using `dep`, import the SDK packages in your code and run `dep ensure`.
* Or you can use the `go get` command (for instance, `go get gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5`).

There are several packages that you can import, depending on which features you are using. You will usually need the following:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
    { label: 'Go SDK versions 4.17.x and earlier', value: 'go-pre-5.0', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
import (
    // go-sdk-common.v2/lduser defines LaunchDarkly's model for user properties
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/lduser"

    // go-server-sdk.v5 is the main SDK package - here we are aliasing it to "ld"
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"

    // go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents is for advanced configuration options
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents"
)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="go-pre-5.0">

```go
import (
    // go-server-sdk.v4 is the main SDK package - here we are aliasing it to "ld"
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v4"
)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

It is usually a good practice to pin your dependencies to a specific version. Refer to the [SDK releases page](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/releases) to identify the latest version. Whenever you update your version of `go-server-sdk`, you should also update `go-sdk-common`.

Once the SDK is installed and imported, you'll want to create a single, shared instance of the LaunchDarkly client ([`LDClient`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient)). You must specify your SDK key here so that your application will be authorized to connect to LaunchDarkly and for your application and environment.

We'll assume you've imported the LaunchDarkly SDK package as `ld`, as shown above.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
ldClient, _ := ld.MakeClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY", 5 * time.Second)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The second argument to `MakeClient` is a timeout parameter: in this case, you are telling the SDK that it can spend up to 5 seconds attempting to connect to LaunchDarkly services before returning to your application. See [`MakeClient`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#MakeClient) for more details about what the timeout means and what happens if initialization fails.

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Best practices for error handling</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The second return type in these code samples ( `_` ) represents an error in case the LaunchDarkly client does not initialize. Consider naming the return value and using it with proper error handling.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>LDClient must be a singleton</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

It's important to make this a singleton. The client instance maintains internal state that allows us to serve feature flags without making any remote requests. **Be sure that you're not instantiating a new client with every request.**

  </CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Using the `LDClient` methods, you can check which variation a particular user should receive for a given feature flag. See [Evaluating flags](/sdk/features/evaluating) and [Flag evaluation reasons](/sdk/features/evaluation-reasons) for more details. See [User configuration](/sdk/features/user-config) for more about how user properties are specified-- in this example, there is a user key that consists of an email address.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
    { label: 'Go SDK versions 4.17.x and earlier', value: 'go-pre-5.0', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
import (
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2/lduser"
)

flagKey := "some-flag-key"
user := lduser.NewUser("some-user-key")
showFeature, _ := ldClient.BoolVariation(flagKey, user, false)
if showFeature {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="go-pre-5.0">

```go
import (
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v4"
)

flagKey := "some-flag-key"
user := ld.NewUser("some-user-key")
showFeature, _ := ldClient.BoolVariation(flagKey, user, false)
if showFeature {
    // application code to show the feature
} else {
    // the code to run if the feature is off
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Lastly, when your application is about to terminate, shut down the `LDClient` with [`Close()`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient.Close). This ensures that the client releases any resources it is using, and that any pending analytics events are delivered to LaunchDarkly. If your application quits without this shutdown step, you may not see your requests and users on the dashboard, because they are derived from analytics events. **This is something you only need to do once**.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
// shut down the client, since we're about to quit
ldClient.Close()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## HTTPS Proxy

Go's standard HTTP library provides a built-in HTTPS proxy. If the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable is present then the SDK will proxy all network requests through the URL provided.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="linux"
  values={[
    { label: 'command line - on Mac or Linux', value: 'linux', },
    { label: 'command line - on Windows', value: 'windows', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="linux">

```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="windows">

```
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You can also specify a proxy programmatically through the SDK configuration:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
    { label: 'Go SDK versions 4.x and earlier', value: 'go-pre-5.0', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
import (
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents"
)

var config ld.Config
config.HTTP = ldcomponents.HTTPConfiguration().
    ProxyURL("https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080")
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="go-pre-5.0">

```go
import (
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v4"
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v4/ldhttp"
)

proxyURL, _ := url.Parse("https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080")

config := ld.DefaultConfig
config.HTTPClientFactory = ldhttp.NewHTTPClientFactory(
    ldhttp.ProxyURL(*proxyURL))

// This is supported only in SDK versions 4.14.0 and higher.
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
