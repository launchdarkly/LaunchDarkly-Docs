## Overview

This topic explains analytics events, how SDKs send them to LaunchDarkly, and what features they are generated for.

All SDKs send analytics events to LaunchDarkly as a result of feature flag evaluations and certain SDK calls. There are several kinds of analytics events. 

Here is a list of analytics event kinds and their functions:
- `feature` and `debug` events identify which feature flags the SDK is evaluating
- `index` and `identify` events push user data to LaunchDarkly
- `alias` events associate two users for analytics purposes
- `page view` and `click` events are sent by JavaScript-based SDKs when pages are visited or clicked as part of an experiment
- `custom` events are sent when an application calls the SDK's `track` method
- `summary` events summarize a series of `feature` events

Analytics events are crucial to the functioning of several features in LaunchDarkly.

<CalloutTitle>Your network must be allowed to send events</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

For analytics events to reach LaunchDarkly, your network must be allowed to send events. Ensure that event streaming endpoints, `mobile.launchdarkly.com` and `events.launchdarkly.com`, are on your allow list. To learn more about how SDKs send events, read [Recording events](/sdk/concepts/contributors-guide#recording-events).

Here is a list of LaunchDarkly features that rely on analytics events:
- [The **Users** dashboard](/home/users/users-dashboard)
- [Targeting rules](/home/flags/targeting-users)
- [Flag statuses](/home/code/flag-status)
- [The debugger](/home/flags/debugger)
- [Data Export](/home/data-export#exporting-event-data-for-flags-and-environments)
- [Experimentation](/home/experimentation/events)

## Event buffering and sending

All LaunchDarkly SDKs automatically send pending analytics events to LaunchDarkly at regular intervals. This is called a flush interval. The buffer between flushes prevents the SDK from having to send constant network requests, and varies by SDK. By default, server-side SDK buffer time is usually a few seconds, and mobile SDK buffer time is around 30 seconds. A longer buffer time for mobile SDKs helps preserve the device's battery life, and events do not need to be flushed as often because events build up much more slowly for client-side SDKs with only one user.

You can configure your SDK's buffer time between flushes. To learn how, read [Configuration](/sdk/features/config).

### Manually calling flush

You can manually call flush to send events immediately without waiting for the next interval. Most customers do not need to use the manual flush feature, but it can be useful if you test the SDK in a simulator. To learn how, read [Flushing events](/sdk/features/flush).

### Shutting down your SDK

You will not need to manually shut down your SDK in most situations. However, if your app dies while there are still events in the buffer, the SDK discards them. If you know your application is about to terminate, or if you're testing an app, you should manually shut down the LaunchDarkly client before quitting to ensure it delivers any pending analytics events to LaunchDarkly. To learn how, read [Shutting down](/sdk/features/shutdown).

### Disabling SDKs from sending events

You can disable SDKs from sending events for testing purposes. To learn more, read [Managing test data in your production environment](/guides/best-practices/testing-code#managing-test-data-in-your-production-environment).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Disable sending events only for testing purposes</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You can disable SDKs from sending events, but we strongly recommend against it outside of testing purposes. Many LaunchDarkly features will not work correctly if they do not regularly receive analytics events.
