## Overview

This topic explains the differences between LaunchDarkly's client- and server-side SDKs and helps you determine which type of SDK to use.

The SDK types have different security considerations as well as some behavioral and architectural differences. They handle flag evaluations differently, use different kinds of SDK keys, and support different languages.

## Understanding the different types of SDKs

It is important to understand the two types of SDKs we support. The different types of SDKs impact critical implementation details and use cases.

All of our SDKs are one of these two categories:

- client-side
- server-side

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Client-side SDKs include mobile SDKs</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Our SDKs primarily for mobile devices, known as our "mobile SDKs", are categorized as client-side SDKs since, like our client-side SDKs, most mobile applications have a single-user context. This includes our Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, and client-side .NET SDKs. Each of these SDKs also has some mobile-specific functionality. To learn more, read [Functional differences between SDKs](#functional-differences-between-sdks).

The table below summarizes the differences between client- and server-side SDKs:

## Functional differences between SDKs

LaunchDarkly attempts to keep all SDKs at feature parity with each other. Even so, slight feature differences exist between server-side, client-side, and mobile SDKs.

### Persistent feature store integrations

By default, our SDKs store transmitted data in in-memory caches. If you don't want to use an in-memory cache, we provide integrations for server-side SDKs to store data in persistent data stores like Redis or DynamoDB instead.

Client-side and mobile SDKs may have platform-specific storage mechanisms and can alternatively use our Relay Proxy.

To learn more, read [Persistent data stores](/sdk/concepts/data-stores).

### Multi-environment support

We designed our SDKs to work with one LaunchDarkly environment at a time. However, mobile application developers might want their applications to be able to access flags on multiple LaunchDarkly environments. We designed the mobile SDKs to support behavior across multiple environments.

For example, if your LaunchDarkly account is set up to have different "Android", "iOS", and "Core" environments and/or projects, you can use the the multi-environment SDK feature to access flags in multiple places.

### Mobile connection state

This feature also pertains specifically to mobile SDKs. Mobile applications are more likely than web or desktop software to lose their network connection. Our mobile SDKs provide additional functionality to monitor the connection state to LaunchDarkly.

## Security

The client-side and server-side SDKs have different security considerations.

### Client-side SDKs

Client-side SDKs typically run on customers' own devices. They can be compromised by users who unpack a mobile app to examine the SDK bytecode or use their browser's developer tools to inspect internal site data. As a result, you should never use a server-side SDK key in a client-side or mobile application.

Flag rules may include user identifiers or other personally identifiable information (PII) that you might not want to transmit to client-side applications. Consequently, client-side SDKs depend on LaunchDarkly's servers to safely store flag rules. To learn more, read [Evaluation reasons](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

### Server-side SDKs

Server-side SDKs operate within server-architected applications running on your own infrastructure or trusted cloud-based infrastructure. Neither of these locations is directly accessible by end users. Because of the limited access to server-based applications, server-side SDKs can safely receive flag data and rulesets without needing to obscure or filter out sensitive data.

## Flag evaluations

The two types of SDKs evaluate feature flags differently. The different evaluation behavior supports data security and efficient data utilization.

### Client-side SDKs

Client-side SDKs are configured to operate for a single user at a time. When a flag evaluation is requested, client-side SDKs delegate the flag evaluation to LaunchDarkly on behalf of the specific user. LaunchDarkly's services are responsible for evaluating flag rules for the user. LaunchDarkly notifies the SDK of the evaluation results, through either the SDK's streaming or polling connections. Then the SDK stores these results for quick lookup.

For security reasons, client-side SDKs cannot download and store an entire ruleset. Client-side SDKs typically run on customers' own devices, so they are vulnerable to having users investigate SDK content by unpacking the SDK on a mobile device or inspecting its behavior in a browser. Instead of storing potentially sensitive data, the client-side SDKs confirm and update flag rules by communicating with LaunchDarkly servers through streaming connections or with REST API requests.

This approach is also beneficial from a data management perspective. Client-side SDKs' bandwidth requirements are lower than server-side SDKs' requirements because LaunchDarkly sends client-side SDKs less data.

### Server-side SDKs

Server-side SDKs receive the complete ruleset associated with an SDK key when they initialize a connection to LaunchDarkly's servers. LaunchDarkly continuously updates the SDK's cached flag ruleset whenever flag rules change on LaunchDarkly, using this persistent connection.

When your application requests flag evaluation, server-side SDKs evaluate feature flags using their cached ruleset, and determine the flag variation for a given user. To do this, they execute an in-process flag evaluation algorithm and return the resulting value.

Server-side SDKs can evaluate flags because these SDKs know your complete flag ruleset. These SDKs can determine users' flag variations without having to make requests to LaunchDarkly's servers for every evaluated flag.

You can think of each flag evaluation as a pure function, where LaunchDarkly uses the provided user context along with the complete ruleset to see if a specific user should be included in an evaluation or not. It is important to note that LaunchDarkly passes along *rule data*, not user data. If a user does not have the correct attributes locally, then it will not be evaluated by the rules that are cached by the SDK.

### Flag evaluation comparison

The client-side SDK requires user information in order to initialize the client. The server-side SDK requires the user context only when the SDK evaluates a flag. 

Here is an example of the differences in flag evaluation between the client-side and server-side SDKs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="Client-side"
  values={[
    { label: 'Client-side', value: 'Client-side', },
    { label: 'Server-side', value: 'Server-side' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="Client-side">

```js

  // JavaScript pseudocode

  var user = {"key": "user_key_123"}

  var ldclient = LDClient.initialize("YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID", user);

  var showFeature = ldclient.variation("FF_KEY", false);

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="Server-side">

```java

  // Java pseudocode

  LDClient ldclient = new LDClient(YOUR_SDK_KEY, config);

  LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder("user_key_123").build();

  boolean showFeature = ldClient.boolVariation("FF_KEY", user, false);

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The client-side flag data does not include sensitive data, so no personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed on the client side if the code is unpacked or inspected. Additionally, bandwidth requirements are lower for the client-side SDKs, because LaunchDarkly sends less data to client-side SDKs.

Here is an example of the differences in flag data received by the client-side and server-side SDKs:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="Client-side"
  values={[
    { label: 'Client-side', value: 'Client-side', },
    { label: 'Server-side', value: 'Server-side' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="Client-side">

```json

  {
    "show-widgets": {
      "version":97,
      "flagVersion": 4,
      "value": false,
      "variation": 1,
      "trackEvents": false
    }
}

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="Server-side">

```json

  {
    "flags":
      "show-widgets": {
        "key":"show-widgets",
        "version":4,
        "on":false,
        "trackEvents":false,
        "trackEventsFallthrough":false,
        "deleted":false,
        "prerequisites":[],
        "salt":"8e0438b01245445d870fa5d8275efd87",
        "sel":"bda12c82c38e4542b32d2d59046820e2",
        "targets":[{"values":["a.user@example.com"],"variation":0}],
        "rules":[ {
          "id":"3803d988-a23d-4a24-a66f-2b151749fd23",
          "variation":0,
          "clauses": [{ "attribute":"email", "op":"in", "values": ["@launchdarkly.com"], "negate":false }],
          "trackEvents":false
        }],
        "fallthrough": {"variation":1},
        "offVariation":1,
        "variations":[true,false],
        "debugEventsUntilDate":null,
        "clientSide":false
      }
  }


```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Private user attributes

You may not want to send all of the user attributes that you are recording back to LaunchDarkly. The security or data protection requirements of your organization may require you to limit what customer or user data is transmitted from your service to a third-party platform like LaunchDarkly.

Both the client-side and server-side SDKs have configuration options to set all or specified user attributes as private attributes.

For both the client-side and server-side SDKs, private user attributes can still be used in targeting rules. With a client-side SDK, LaunchDarkly processes private attributes, but does not store them. With a server-side SDK, LaunchDarkly does not process or store private attributes.

Here is an example of setting all attributes as private:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="Client-side"
  values={[
    { label: 'Client-side', value: 'Client-side', },
    { label: 'Server-side', value: 'Server-side' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="Client-side">

```js

  // JavaScript pseudocode

  var ldclient = LDClient.initialize('CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user,
    options = { allAttributesPrivate: true });

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="Server-side">

```java

  // Java pseudocode

  LDConfig configWithAllAttributesPrivate = new LDConfig.Builder()
    .events(
      Components.sendEvents()
        .allAttributesPrivate(true)
    )
    .build();

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Note that the user `key` attribute can never be private.

Here is an example of setting just the user's email address as private:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="Client-side"
  values={[
    { label: 'Client-side', value: 'Client-side', },
    { label: 'Server-side', value: 'Server-side' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="Client-side">

```js

  // JavaScript pseudocode

  var ldclient = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user,
    options = { privateAttributeNames: ["email"] });

```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="Server-side">

```java

  // Java pseudocode

  LDConfig configWithSpecificAttributesPrivate = new LDConfig.Builder()
  .events(
    Components.sendEvents()
      .privateAttributes(UserAttribute.EMAIL)
  )
  .build();

  LDUser user = new LDUser.Builder("user_key_123")
    .privateEmail("test@example.com")
    .build();

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Keys

Before embedding an SDK key into your application's LaunchDarkly configuration, you must identify which category of SDK you're using so that you can select the appropriate SDK key.

The [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects) page lists three keys for each environment:

- SDK key
- mobile key
- client-side ID

Each of these keys grants different access levels to LaunchDarkly's APIs.

LaunchDarkly enforces that each of the SDK types use the appropriate key as described below. Requests made with one of the other two keys will be rejected. To identify which keys are used by each SDK, read [Language support](#language-support).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Making flags available to client-side SDKs</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Use the "Client-side SDK availability" section on a flag's **Settings** tab to make flags available to client-side SDKs.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

### SDK key

Configure server-side SDKs to use the SDK key. This key grants server-side SDKs read-only access to all flag data associated with the provided key's environment. With this key, server-side SDKs can download the entire flag ruleset for all flags in the environment.

The SDK key should be kept a secret. If an SDK key is exposed, you can reset it from the **Account settings** page. To learn how, read [Resetting an environment's key](/home/organize/environments#resetting-an-environments-key).

### Mobile key

Configure mobile SDKs, and other non-JavaScript client-side SDKs, to use the mobile key. The mobile key grants these SDKs access to evaluate any flag that is associated with the key's environment, and that you have enabled for client-side SDK availability by checking the flag's "SDKs using mobile key" checkbox.

Because you must manually connect flags to a client-side SDK, you can restrict which flags are accessible by the client-side ID.

The mobile key does not need to be kept a secret. However, if you wish to reset a mobile key, you can do so from the **Account settings** page. To learn how, read [Resetting an environment's key](/home/organize/environments#resetting-an-environments-key).

### Client-side ID

Configure JavaScript-based client-side SDKs to use the client-side ID. The client-side ID grants these SDKs access to evaluate any flags that are associated with the key's environment, and that you have enabled for client-side SDK availability by checking the flag's **SDKs using Client-side key** checkbox. Because you must manually connect flags to a client-side SDK, you can restrict which flags are accessible by the client-side ID.

Unlike a mobile key, the client-side ID for an environment never changes. The client-side ID does not need to be kept a secret.

## Language support

We offer SDKs for many languages and technologies. Some, but not all, languages have client- and server-side SDKs available.
