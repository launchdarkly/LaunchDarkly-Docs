## Overview

This topic explains how various SDKs monitor the connection to LaunchDarkly to determine the most recent flag values.

## Monitoring the connection to LaunchDarkly

Some SDKs expose some of their internal statuses through the Connection Status API to allow your application to monitor the SDK's status. This is provided primarily as a mechanism for the application to determine how recently the internal flag cache has been updated with the most recent values, as well as diagnosing potential reasons for the flag cache to be out of date.

* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)
* [Electron](#electron)
* [Flutter](#flutter)
* [iOS](#ios)
* [React Native](#react-native)

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Supported versions</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This feature is available in the client-side .NET SDK's versions 2.0.0 and later.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The client-side .NET SDK defines "data source status" as the status of the SDK's communication with LaunchDarkly to get feature flag data. If the streaming connection to LaunchDarkly is interrupted, or, in polling mode, if a polling request fails, the SDK might not be able to receive flag updates. The data source status will indicate this, providing an overall state such as "valid" or "interrupted" and information about the last error that occurred, if any.

To check the data source status:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
var dataSourceStatus = client.DataSourceStatusProvider.Status;
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Alternatively, you can register an event handler that will receive a new status value whenever the status changes.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
client.DataSourceStatusProvider.StatusChanged +=
    (sender, status) -> {
        Console.WriteLine("new status is: {0}", status);
    };
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

### Android

<Details summary="Expand Android code sample">

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Supported versions</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This feature is available in the Android SDK's versions 2.8.0 and later.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

The Android SDK exposes some of its internal status through APIs to let your application monitor it. This allows the application to determine how recently the internal flag cache has been updated with the most recent values, as well as diagnosing potential reasons for the flag cache to be out of date.

The SDK has seven connectivity states dependent on its configuration, application foreground state, network connectivity, and calls explicitly setting the client offline or online.

This table describes the states:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Connection mode</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>STREAMING</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The SDK is either connected to the flag stream, or is actively attempting to acquire a connection.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>POLLING</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>The SDK is in foreground polling mode because it was configured with streaming disabled.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>BACKGROUND_POLLING</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The SDK has detected the application is in the background and has transitioned to battery-saving background
        polling.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>BACKGROUND_DISABLED</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The SDK was configured with background polling disabled. The SDK has detected the application is in the
        background and is not attempting to update the flag cache.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>OFFLINE</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The SDK has detected that the mobile device does not have an active network connection. It has ceased flag update
        attempts until the network status changes.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>SET_OFFLINE</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The SDK has been explicitly set offline, either in the initial configuration, by <code>setOffline()</code>, or
        as a result of failed authentication to LaunchDarkly. The SDK will stay offline unless <code>setOnline()</code>{' '}
        is called.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>SHUTDOWN</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        The shutdown state indicates the SDK has been permanently shutdown as a result of a call to <code>close()</code>
        .
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

The SDK also internally stores a timestamp of the most recent successful and failed connections to LaunchDarkly, as well as information related to the most recent failed connection. The `LDClient` method `getConnectionInformation()` returns a structure allowing retrieval of these fields.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java">

```java
LDClient client = LDClient.get();
ConnectionInformation connectionInfo = client.getConnectionInformation();
// One of the seven modes described above
ConnectionInformation.ConnectionMode connectionMode =
  connectionInfo.getConnectionMode();
// Most recent successful flag cache update in millis from the epoch
// Or null if flags have never been retrieved
Long lastSuccess = connectionInfo.getLastSuccessfulConnection();
// Most recent unsuccessful flag cache update attempt in millis from the epoch
// Or null if flag update has never been attempted
Long lastError = connectionInfo.getLastFailedConnection();
// Most recent failure or null
LDFailure ldFailure = connectionInfo.getLastFailure();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val client: LDClient = LDClient.get()
val connectionInfo: ConnectionInformation = client.connectionInformation
// One of the seven modes described above
val connectionMode: ConnectionInformation.ConnectionMode =
    connectionInfo.connectionMode
// Most recent successful flag cache update in millis from the epoch
// Or null if flags have never been retrieved
val lastSuccess: Long? = connectionInfo.lastSuccessfulConnection
// Most recent unsuccessful flag cache update attempt in millis from the epoch
// Or null if flag update has never been attempted
val lastError: Long? = connectionInfo.lastFailedConnection
// Most recent failure or null
val ldFailure: LDFailure? = connectionInfo.lastFailure
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

`LDFailure` is a `LaunchDarklyException` with an associated `FailureType`. It may include a `.cause()`, which is propagated from an underlying exception associated with the update's failure. The cause itself should be considered unstable because it is dependent on internal implementation, though the mechanism to retrieve it will be maintained.

The failure types are summarized below:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>FailureType</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>INVALID_RESPONSE_BODY</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>A response body received either through polling or streaming was unable to be parsed.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>NETWORK_FAILURE</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        A network request for polling, or the <code>EventSource</code> stream reported a failure.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>UNEXPECTED_STREAM_ELEMENT_TYPE</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        An event was received through the stream with an unknown event name. This could indicate a newer SDK is available if new event kinds have become available through the flag stream since the SDK's release.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE_CODE</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>
        This indicates the <code>LDFailure</code> is an instance of <code>LDInvalidResponseCodeFailure</code>. Continue reading below for more details.
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>UNKNOWN_ERROR</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>Some other issue occurred.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

If matching on the `FailureType`, use a default case to handle any future cases provided. The `UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE_CODE` case indicates that you can cast the `LDFailure` to a `LDInvalidResponseCodeFailure` for more information. This more specific failure includes a response code and whether the failure is considered retryable.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java">

```java
LDClient client = LDClient.get();
ConnectionInformation connectionInfo = client.getConnectionInformation();
LDFailure ldFailure = connectionInfo.getLastFailure();
if (ldFailure != null) {
    Timber.d("Received failure with message %s", ldFailure.getMessage());
    // Retrieve the failure type
    LDFailure.FailureType failureType = ldFailure.getFailureType();
    switch (failureType) {
        case INVALID_RESPONSE_BODY:
            Timber.d("Received invalid response body");
            break;
        case NETWORK_FAILURE:
            Timber.d("Network failure, may have bad connection");
            break;
        case UNEXPECTED_STREAM_ELEMENT_TYPE:
            Timber.d("Unexpected stream element, may require update");
            break;
        case UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE_CODE:
            LDInvalidResponseCodeFailure responseCodeFailure =
                (LDInvalidResponseCodeFailure) ldFailure;
            int responseCode = responseCodeFailure.getResponseCode();
            if (responseCodeFailure.isRetryable()) {
                Timber.d("Received invalid response code %d", responseCode);
            } else {
                Timber.d("Received invalid response code %d, giving up", responseCode);
            }
            break;
        case UNKNOWN_ERROR:
        default:
            Timber.d("Unknown error");
            break;
    }

    Throwable cause = ldFailure.getCause();
    if (cause != null) {
        // Do something with underlying cause
    }
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val client: LDClient = LDClient.get()
val connectionInfo: ConnectionInformation = client.connectionInformation
val ldFailure: LDFailure? = connectionInfo.lastFailure

    if (cause != null) {
        // Do something with underlying cause
    }
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

A callback-based interface is also provided to allow notifying the application when the `ConnectionMode` changes, as well as whenever the `LDFailure` in `ConnectionStatus` changes. The application must provide a class instance implementing `LDStatusListener` to the SDK client instance method `registerStatusListener` to register the listeners with the SDK.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Listener weak reference</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The SDK maintains only a weak reference to the registered `LDStatusListener`, so the application maintains a reference for as long as the application desires the listener to be available. This helps prevent creating a long-term reference to an Activity by creating a static internal class instance for use as a listener. By using a weak reference to the listener, the Activity can still be garbage collected normally, even if it maintains a registered `LDStatusListener`. We recommend unregistering the listener when it's finished.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

Here is a brief example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java">

```java
class MainActivity extends Activity {
    private LDClient client;
    private LDStatusListener ldStatusListener;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        ldStatusListener = new LDStatusListener() {
            @Override
            public void onConnectionModeChanged(ConnectionInformation connectionInfo) {
                // handle new connection info
            }

            @Override
            public void onInternalFailure(LDFailure ldFailure) {
                // handle failure
            }
        };

        client = LDClient.get();
        client.registerStatusListener(ldStatusListener);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        client.unregisterStatusListener(ldStatusListener);
    }
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Kotlin">

```kotlin

    private var client: LDClient? = null
    private var ldStatusListener: LDStatusListener? = null

### Electron

<Details summary="Expand Electron code sample">

By default, the client requests feature flag values only once per user. This happens once at startup time, and then each time you call `identify()`. You can also use a persistent connection to receive flag updates whenever they occur.

Enable this behavior by setting `streaming` to `true` in the client options or calling `client.setStreaming(true)`. LaunchDarkly pushes new values to the SDK, which updates the current feature flag state in the background, ensuring that `variation()` always returns the latest values.

If you want to be notified when a flag has changed, you can use an event listener for a specific flag.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
client.on('change:flag-key-123abc', (newValue, oldValue) => {
  console.log('The flag was ' + oldValue + ' and now it is ' + newValue);
});
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Alternatively, you can listen for all feature flag changes.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```js
client.on('change', (allFlagChanges) => {
  Object.keys(allFlagChanges).forEach((key) => {
    console.log('Flag ' + key + ' is now ' + allFlagChanges[key]);
  });
});
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Subscribing to `change` events automatically turns on streaming mode as well, unless you have explicitly set `streaming` to `false`.
</Details>

### Flutter

<Details summary="Expand Flutter code sample">

The Flutter SDK exposes some of its internal status through APIs to let your application monitor it. This allows the application to determine how recently the internal flag cache has been updated with the most recent values, as well as diagnosing potential reasons for the flag cache to be out of date.

The SDK also stores a timestamp of the most recent successful and failed connections to LaunchDarkly, as well as information related to the most recent failed connection. The `LDClient` method `getConnectionInformation()` returns a structure that lets you retrieve these fields.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Dart">

```dart
LDConnectionInformation connectionInfo = await LDClient.getConnectionInformation();
// The current connection state
LDConnectionState connectionState = connectionInfo.connectionState;
// Most recent successful flag cache update
DateTime? lastSuccess = connectionInfo.lastSuccessfulConnection;
// Most recent unsuccessful flag cache update attempt
DateTime? lastfailure = connectionInfo.lastFailedConnection;
// Most recent failure or null
LDFailure? ldFailure = connectionInfo.lastFailure;
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more about the connection status fields, read the [API docs](https://launchdarkly.github.io/flutter-client-sdk/launchdarkly_flutter_client_sdk/LDConnectionInformation-class.html).
</Details>

### iOS

<Details summary="Expand iOS code sample">

The iOS SDK exposes some of its internal status through the Connection Status API to let your application monitor it. This allows the application to determine how recently the internal flag cache has been updated with the most recent values, as well as diagnosing potential reasons for the flag cache to be out of date.

The SDK has four connectivity states dependent on its configuration, application foreground state, network connectivity, and calls explicitly setting the client offline or online.

This table describes the states:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>Connection Mode</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>streaming</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>The SDK has an active streaming connection.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>polling</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>The SDK has an active polling connection.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>offline</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>The SDK is set offline or has no network connection.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>establishingStreamingConnection</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>The SDK is attempting to connect to LaunchDarkly by streaming.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

The SDK also stores a timestamp of the most recent successful and failed connections to LaunchDarkly, as well as information related to the most recent failed connection. `lastKnownFlagValidity` is nil if either no connection has ever been made successfully or if the SDK has an active streaming connection. It has a value if it is in polling mode and at least one poll has completed successfully, or if it is in streaming mode whenever the streaming connection closes. The `LDClient.shared` method `getConnectionInformation()` returns a structure that lets you retrieve these fields.

The `ConnectionInformation` class can return four different values for `lastFailureReason`.

This table describes the values:

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableHeadCell>lastFailureReason value</TableHeadCell>
    <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>none</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>This returns when no error has been recorded.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>unknownError</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>This returns when there is an internal error in the stream request.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>unauthorized</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>This returns when an incorrect mobile key is provided.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>
        <code>httpError</code>
      </TableCell>
      <TableCell>This returns when an error with an HTTP error code is present.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

You can listen to changes in `ConnectionInformation.ConnectionMode` in a similar manner to flag observers.

Here is an example of the API:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Swift">

```swift
// Get current connection information
let connectionInformation = LDClient.get()!.getConnectionInformation()
// Setting a connection mode update observer
LDClient.get()!.observeCurrentConnectionMode(owner: self) { [weak self] connectionMode in
    // do something after ConnectionMode was updated.
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### React Native

<Details summary="Expand React Native code sample">

The React Native SDK exposes some of its internal status through the Connection Status API to allow your application to monitor the SDK's status. It provides this primarily as a mechanism for the application to determine how recently the internal flag cache has been updated with the most recent values, as well as diagnose potential reasons for the flag cache to be out of date.

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

To learn more about the return types, read the API documentation about [`LDConnectionMode`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/interfaces/LDConnectionMode.html) and [`LDFailureReason`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-native-client-sdk/interfaces/LDFailureReason.html).
</Details>

## Server-side SDKs

The following server-side SDKs provide two kinds of SDK status monitoring:

* Data source status
* Data store status

Data source status is the status of the SDK's communication with LaunchDarkly to get feature flag data. If the streaming connection to LaunchDarkly is interrupted, or, in polling mode, if a polling request fails, the SDK might not be able to receive flag updates. The data source status will indicate this, providing an overall state such as "valid" or "interrupted" and information about the last error that occurred, if any.

Data store status is the status of a database, such as Redis or DynamoDB, if the SDK has been configured to use one. If the SDK tries to read from or write to a database and encounters an error, the data store status will indicate this.

This feature is available in the following server-side SDKs:

* [.NET (server-side)](#net-server-side)
* [Go](#go)
* [Java](#java)

### .NET (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (server-side) code sample">

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>Supported versions</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

This feature is available in the .NET SDK's versions 6.0.0 and later.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

To check the data source status:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
var dataSourceStatus = client.DataSourceStatusProvider.Status;
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Alternatively, you can register an event handler that will receive a new status value whenever the status changes.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
client.DataSourceStatusProvider.StatusChanged +=
    (sender, status) -> {
        Console.WriteLine("new status is: {0}", status);
    };
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### Go

<Details summary="Expand Go code sample">

To check the data source status:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go">

```go
dataSourceStatus := client.GetDataSourceStatusProvider().GetStatus()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Alternatively, you can monitor a channel that provides a new status value whenever the status changes:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go">

```go
dataStoreStatusChannel := client.GetDataStoreStatusProvider().AddStatusListener()
go func() {
    for status := range dataStoreStatusChannel {
        fmt.Println("new status is: ", status)
    }
}()
```
