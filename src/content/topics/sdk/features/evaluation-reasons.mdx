## Overview

This topic explains how to use the flag evaluation reason feature to get more information about the flag variations LaunchDarkly serves to users.

To learn more about how LaunchDarkly determines why a user receives a given flag variation, read [Evaluation reasons](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

## Understanding the flag evaluation reason feature

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

The `VariationDetail` methods, such as `BoolVariationDetail`, work the same as `Variation`, but also provide additional "reason" information about how a flag value was calculated. For example, you can find out if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp

Configuration config = Configuration
  .Builder("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY")
  .EvaluationReasons(true)
  .Build();
LdClient client = LdClient.Init(config, user);

EvaluationDetail<bool> detail =
  client.BoolVariationDetail("flag-key", false);
  // or StringVariationDetail for a string-valued flag, etc.

bool value = detail.Value;
int? index = detail.VariationIndex;
EvaluationReason reason = detail.Reason;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more about the `VariationDetail` methods, read [`EvaluationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.EvaluationDetail-1.html) and [`BoolVariationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Client.LdClient.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Client_LdClient_BoolVariationDetail_). To learn more about the configuration option, read [`EvaluationReasons`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-client-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Client.ConfigurationBuilder.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Client_ConfigurationBuilder_EvaluationReasons_System_Boolean_).

### Android

<Details summary="Expand Android code sample">

The `variationDetail` methods, such as `boolVariationDetail`, work the same as `variation`. They also provide additional "reason" information about how a flag value was calculated, such as if the user matched a specific rule. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs

### C/C++ (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand C/C++ (client-side) code sample">

By passing an `LDVariationDetails` struct to a variation call you can programmatically inspect the reason for a particular evaluation.

The `details.reason` member is the `reason` object described in [Evaluation reasons](/sdk/concepts/evaluation-reasons).

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
defaultValue="c"
values={[
    { label: 'C', value: 'c'},
    { label: 'C++', value: 'c++'},
]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

LDBoolean value;

value = LDBoolVariationDetail(client, "your.feature.key", LDBooleanFalse, &details);

/* inspect details.reason, which is a JSON object */
if (strcmp(LDGetText(LDObjectLookup(details->reason, "errorKind")), "FLAG_NOT_FOUND") == 0) {
    /* ... */
}

LDFreeDetailContents(&details);
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="c++">

### iOS

<Details summary="Expand iOS code sample">

The `variationDetail` methods, such as `boolVariationDetail`, work the same as the variation methods. They also provide additional "reason" information about how a flag value was calculated, such as if the user matched a specific rule. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

### JavaScript

<Details summary="Expand JavaScript code sample">

The `variationDetail` method lets you evaluate a feature flag with the same parameters you would for `variation`. With `variationDetail`, you receive more information about how the value was calculated.

The variation detail returns in an object containing both the result value and a "reason" object which tells you more information about the flag evaluation. For example, you can find out if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. It also indicates if the flag returned the default value due to an error. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
const options = { evaluationReasons: true };
const client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options);

const detail = client.variationDetail('flag-key', false);

const value = detail.value;
const index = detail.variationIndex;
const reason = detail.reason;
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more about the `variationDetail` methods, read [`LDEvaluationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/_launchdarkly_js_client_sdk_.ldevaluationdetail.html) and [`variationDetail`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/_launchdarkly_js_client_sdk_.ldclient.html#variationdetail).

### Roku

<Details summary="Expand Roku code sample">

For each variation type there is also an associated version that returns the reason a particular value was returned.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="brightscript"
  values={[
    { label: 'BrightScript', value: 'brightscript', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="brightscript">

```brightscript
config.setUseEvaluationReasons(true)

details = launchDarkly.intVariationDetail("YOUR_FLAG_KEY", 123)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

These variation methods return an object containing the keys `value`, `reason`, and `variationIndex`. The `value` field is the result of the evaluation. The `reason` field is an object that explains why the result happened, for example details about a rule match. The reason object will always contain a `kind` field. Lastly the `variationIndex` field contains the ID of the particular value returned. This field may be null.
</Details>

## Server-side SDKs

### Go

<Details summary="Expand Go code sample">

The `VariationDetail` methods ([`BoolVariationDetail`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#LDClient.BoolVariationDetail), etc.) work the same as `Variation`, but also provide additional "reason" information about how a flag value was calculated. For example, you can find out if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs

```go
value, detail, err := client.BoolVariationDetail("flag-key", myUser, false)
// or StringVariationDetail for a string-valued flag, etc.

index := detail.VariationIndex
reason := detail.Reason

// In Go SDK 5.0 and higher, detail.VariationIndex uses the type ldvalue.OptionalInt, which
// allows an "undefined" state if evaluation failed. In earlier Go SDK versions, it is an
// *int which is nil if evaluation failed.
```

  case ldreason.EvalReasonError:
    fmt.Printf("error: %s\n", r.GetErrorKind())
  }
  // or, if all you want is a simple descriptive string:
  fmt.Println(reason)
}

// The example above is for Go SDK 5.0 and higher. In earlier versions, the

The `variationDetail` functions are similar to the `variation` functions, but they also return an explanation of the evaluation that is programmatically inspectable.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="haskell"
  values={[
    { label: 'Haskell', value: 'haskell', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="haskell">

```haskell
details :: IO (EvaluationDetail Bool)
details = boolVariationDetail client user "YOUR_FEATURE_KEY" False
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

For specific information on the `EvaluationDetail` structure, inspect the `LaunchDarkly.Server.Details` module.

### Java

<Details summary="Expand Java code sample">

The `variationDetail` methods ([`boolVariationDetail`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/java-server-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/LDClient.html#boolVariationDetail-java.lang.String-com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDUser-boolean-), etc.) work the same as `variation`, but also provide additional "reason" information about how a flag value was calculated. For example, you can find out if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
import com.launchdarkly.sdk.*;

EvaluationDetail<Boolean> detail =
  client.boolVariationDetail("flag-key", myUser, false);
  // or stringVariationDetail for a string-valued flag, etc.

boolean value = detail.getValue();
int index = detail.getVariationIndex();       // will be < 0 if evaluation failed
EvaluationReason reason = detail.getReason();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Lua

<Details summary="Expand Lua code sample">

By using the `*Detail` family of variation calls you can programmatically inspect the reason for a particular evaluation:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="lua"
  values={[
    { label: 'Lua', value: 'lua', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="lua">

```lua
local details = client:boolVariationDetail(client, user, "your.feature.key", false);

/* inspect details here */
if details.reason == "FLAG_NOT_FOUND" then
end
```

### Node.js (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand Node.js (server-side) code sample">

The `variationDetail` method lets you evaluate a feature flag (using the same parameters as you would for `variation`) and receive more information about how the value was calculated.

The variation detail is returned in an object that contains both the result value and a "reason" object which will tell you, for instance, if the user was individually targeted for the flag or was matched by one of the flag's rules. It will also indicate if the flag returned the default value due to an error. You can examine the "reason" data programmatically, or, if you capture detailed analytics events for flags, view it with Data Export.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
var detail = client.variationDetail('flag-key', user, false);

var value = detail.value;
var index = detail.variationIndex;
var reason = detail.reason;
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="ts">

```ts
client.variationDetail('flag-key', user, 'default',
  (detail) => {
    const detailValue = detail.value;
    const detailIndex = detail.variationIndex;
    const detailReason = detail.reason;
