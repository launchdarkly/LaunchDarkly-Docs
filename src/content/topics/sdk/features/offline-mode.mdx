## Overview

This topic explains how to set an SDK to offline mode.

## Understanding offline mode

Offline mode closes an SDK's connection to LaunchDarkly and switches to a feature flag's last known values.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

If a user's device is not connected to a network, such as when the device is in airplane mode, the SDK uses the latest stored flag settings in memory. If there are no previously stored flag settings, the SDK uses the default values.

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)
* [Flutter](#flutter)
* [iOS](#ios)
* [React Native](#react-native)

### .NET (client-side)

The default (fallback) values are defined in your code. The default value only returns if an error is encountered or if LaunchDarkly is unreachable.

In some situations, you might want avoid remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on-premises. You can do this by setting offline mode in the client's Config. When the client is in offline mode, no network requests will be made, so it is suitable for unit-testing.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
Configuration config = Configuration.Builder("SDK_KEY")
    .Offline(true)
    .Build();
LdClient client = LdClient.Init(config);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Android

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and switch to the last known values for your feature flags. `offline` mode lets you do this easily.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
    { label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
LDConfig ldConfig = new LDConfig.Builder()
    .setMobileKey("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY")
    .setOffline(true)
    .build();

LDClient client = LDClient.init(this.getApplication(), ldConfig, user);

// Or to switch an already-instantiated client to offline mode:
client.setOffline();
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val config: LDConfig = LDConfig.Builder()
    .setMobileKey("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY")
    .setOffline(true)
    .build()

val client: LDClient = LDClient.init(application, ldConfig, user);

// Or to switch an already-instantiated client to offline mode:
client.setOffline()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Flutter

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and rely on locally cached values for your feature flags for future evaluations. `offline` mode lets you do this easily.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
LDConfig ldConfig = LDConfigBuilder('YOUR_MOBILE_KEY')
    .setOffline(true)
    .build();

await LDClient.start(ldConfig, user);

// Or to switch an already-instantiated client to offline mode:
await LDClient.setOnline(false);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### iOS

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and switch to the last known values for your feature flags. Offline mode lets you do this easily.

The SDK protects itself from multiple rapid calls to `setOnline(true)` by enforcing an increasing delay (called _throttling_) each time `setOnline(true)` is called within a short time. The first time, the call proceeds normally. For each subsequent call, the delay is enforced, and if waiting, increased to a maximum delay. When the delay has elapsed, the `setOnline(true)` proceeds, assuming that the client app has not called `setOnline(false)` during the delay. Therefore, a call to `setOnline(true)` may not immediately result in the LDClient going online.

Client app developers should consider this situation abnormal, and take steps to prevent the client app from making multiple rapid `setOnline(true)` calls. Calls to `setOnline(false)` are not throttled. Calls to `start(config: user: completion:)`, and setting the `config` or `user` can also call `setOnline(true)` under certain conditions. After the delay, the SDK resets and the client app can make a subsequent call to `setOnline(true)` without being throttled.

Client apps can set a completion closure called when the setOnline call completes. For unthrottled `setOnline(true)` and all `setOnline(false)` calls, the SDK calls the closure immediately on completion of this method. For throttled `setOnline(true)` calls, the SDK calls the closure after the throttling delay at the completion of the `setOnline` method.

The SDK does not go online if the client has not been started, or the `mobileKey` is empty. For macOS, the SDK does not go online in the background unless `enableBackgroundUpdates` is true.

Use `isOnline` to get the online/offline state.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
LDClient.get()!.setOnline(false)
LDClient.get()!.setOnline(true) {
    // Client is online
}
let connectionStatus = LDClient.get()!.isOnline
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
[[LDClient get] setOnline:NO];
[[LDClient get] setOnline:YES completion:^() {
    // Client is online
}];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### React Native

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and switch to the last known values for your feature flags. Offline mode lets you do this easily.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
let offlineResult = client.setOffline(); //true or false
let offlineStatus = client.isOffline(); //true or false
let onlineResult = client.setOnline(); //true or false
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Server-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following server-side SDKs:

* [.NET (server-side)](#net-server-side)
* [C/C++ (server-side)](#cc-server-side)
* [Erlang](#erlang)
* [Go](#go)
* [Haskell](#haskell)
* [Java](#java)
* [Node.js (server-side)](#nodejs-server-side)
* [PHP](#php)
* [Python](#python)

### .NET (server-side)

The default (fallback) values are defined in your code. The default value only returns if an error is encountered or if LaunchDarkly is unreachable.

In some situations, you might want avoid remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on-premises.

```csharp
Configuration config = Configuration.Builder("SDK_KEY")
    .Offline(true)
    .Build();

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### C/C++ (server-side)

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on-premises.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="c"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'c', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="c">

```c
LDConfigSetOffline(config, true);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Erlang

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to your feature flags' default values.

For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when the software runs on-premises.

You can do this by setting offline mode in the config map with the `offline` key.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="erlang"
  values={[
    { label: 'Erlang', value: 'erlang', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="erlang">

```
ldclient:start_instance("YOUR_SDK_KEY", #{offline => true})
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Go

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on-premises. You can do this by setting `Offline` mode in the client's [`Config`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5#Config).

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="go"
  values={[
    { label: 'Go', value: 'go', },
    { label: 'Go SDK versions 4.17.x and earlier', value: 'go-pre-5.0', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="go">

```go
var config ld.Config
config.Offline = true

client, _ := ld.MakeCustomClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY", config, 5 * time.Second)
client.BoolVariation("any.feature.flag", user, false) // will always return the default value (false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="go-pre-5.0">

```go
config := ld.DefaultConfig
config.Offline = true

client, _ := ld.MakeCustomClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY", config, 5 * time.Second)
client.BoolVariation("any.feature.flag", user, false) // will always return the default value (false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Haskell

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. You can do this by setting offline mode in the config object with `configSetOffline`.

For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on-premises.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="haskell"
  values={[
    { label: 'Haskell', value: 'haskell', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="haskell">

```haskell
config' = configSetOffline True config
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Java

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on-premises. You can do this by setting [`offline`](http://launchdarkly.github.io/java-server-sdk/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/LDConfig.Builder.html#offline-boolean-) mode in the client's `LDConfig`.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
LDConfig config = new LDConfig.Builder()
  .offline(true)
  .build();
LDClient client = new LDClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY", config);
client.boolVariation("any.feature.flag", user, false)

// This call to client.boolVariation always
// returns the default value (false)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

### Node.js (server-side)

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on-premises. You can do this by setting `offline` mode in the client's `config` object.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Node.js', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
var config = {"offline": true};
client = LaunchDarkly.init("YOUR_SDK_KEY", config);
client.variation("any.feature.flag", user, false, cb) // cb will always be invoked with the default value (false)

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Note that the default value you set in the variation method will be returned in offline mode, this does not refer to the default rule set in your flag configuration.

### PHP

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and fall back to default values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to fall back to defaults when running on-premises. `setOffline` lets you do this easily.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="php"
  values={[
    { label: 'PHP', value: 'php', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="php">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("YOUR_SDK_KEY", array("offline" => true));
$client->variation("any.feature.flag", user, false); // will always return the default value (false)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
