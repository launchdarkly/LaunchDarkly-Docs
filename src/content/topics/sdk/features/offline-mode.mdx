## Overview

This topic explains how to set an SDK to offline mode.

## Understanding offline mode

Offline mode closes an SDK's connection to LaunchDarkly and switches to a feature flag's last known values.

Details about each SDK's configuration are available in the SDK-specific sections below.

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

If a user's device is not connected to a network, such as when the device is in airplane mode, the SDK uses the latest stored flag settings in memory. If there are no previously stored flag settings, the SDK uses the default values.

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)
* [Flutter](#flutter)
* [iOS](#ios)
* [React Native](#react-native)

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

The fallback values are defined in your code. The SDK returns the fallback value only if it encounters an error or if LaunchDarkly is unreachable.

In some situations, you might want avoid remote calls to LaunchDarkly and use fallback values for your feature flags. For example, if your software is both cloud-hosted and distributed to customers to run on-premises, it might make sense to use fallback values when running on-premises. You can do this by setting offline mode in the client's Config. When the client is in offline mode, it makes no network requests, so it is suitable for unit-testing.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="csharp"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example', value: 'csharp', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
Configuration config = Configuration.Builder("SDK_KEY")
    .Offline(true)
    .Build();
LdClient client = LdClient.Init(config);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
</Details>

### Android

<Details summary="Expand Android code sample">

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and switch to the last known values for your feature flags. `offline` mode lets you do this easily.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="java"
  values={[
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
    { label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin' }
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="java">

```java
LDConfig ldConfig = new LDConfig.Builder()
    .setMobileKey("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY")
    .setOffline(true)
    .build();

LDClient client = LDClient.init(this.getApplication(), ldConfig, user);

// Or to switch an already-instantiated client to offline mode:
client.setOffline();
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val config: LDConfig = LDConfig.Builder()
    .setMobileKey("YOUR_MOBILE_KEY")
    .setOffline(true)
    .build()

val client: LDClient = LDClient.init(application, ldConfig, user);

// Or to switch an already-instantiated client to offline mode:
client.setOffline()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
</Details>

### Flutter

<Details summary="Expand Flutter code sample">

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and rely on locally cached values for your feature flags for future evaluations. `offline` mode lets you do this easily.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="dart"
  values={[
    { label: 'Dart', value: 'dart', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="dart">

```dart
LDConfig ldConfig = LDConfigBuilder('YOUR_MOBILE_KEY')
    .offline(true)
    .build();

await LDClient.start(ldConfig, user);

// Or to switch an already-instantiated client to offline mode:
await LDClient.setOnline(false);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
</Details>

### iOS

<Details summary="Expand iOS code sample">

In some situations, you might want to stop making remote calls to LaunchDarkly and switch to the last known values for your feature flags. Offline mode lets you do this easily.

The SDK protects itself from multiple rapid calls to `setOnline(true)` by enforcing an increasing delay (called _throttling_) each time `setOnline(true)` is called within a short time. The first time, the call proceeds normally. For each subsequent call, the delay is enforced, and if waiting, increased to a maximum delay. When the delay has elapsed, the `setOnline(true)` proceeds, assuming that the client app has not called `setOnline(false)` during the delay. Therefore, a call to `setOnline(true)` may not immediately result in the LDClient going online.

Client app developers should consider this situation abnormal, and take steps to prevent the client app from making multiple rapid `setOnline(true)` calls. Calls to `setOnline(false)` are not throttled. Calls to `start(config: user: completion:)`, and setting the `config` or `user` can also call `setOnline(true)` under certain conditions. After the delay, the SDK resets and the client app can make a subsequent call to `setOnline(true)` without being throttled.

Client apps can set a completion closure called when the setOnline call completes. For unthrottled `setOnline(true)` and all `setOnline(false)` calls, the SDK calls the closure immediately on completion of this method. For throttled `setOnline(true)` calls, the SDK calls the closure after the throttling delay at the completion of the `setOnline` method.

The SDK does not go online if the client has not been started, or the `mobileKey` is empty. For macOS, the SDK does not go online in the background unless `enableBackgroundUpdates` is true.

Use `isOnline` to get the online/offline state.

Here is an example:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift', },
    { label: 'Objective-C', value: 'objc', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="swift">

```swift
LDClient.get()!.setOnline(false)
LDClient.get()!.setOnline(true) {
    // Client is online
}
let connectionStatus = LDClient.get()!.isOnline
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="objc">

```objectivec
[[LDClient get] setOnline:NO];
[[LDClient get] setOnline:YES completion:^() {
    // Client is online
}];
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>
</Details>
