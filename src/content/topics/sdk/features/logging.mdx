## Overview

This topic explains how to configure the logging feature. Logging is available for both client-side and server-side SDKs.

## Configuring logging

LaunchDarkly SDKs rely on built-in logging packages and libraries to track events. Depending on which language you use, you can configure logging behavior to be highly or minimally verbose.

* [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks)
* [Server-side SDKs](#server-side-sdks)
* [Edge SDKs](#edge-sdks)

## Client-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following client-side SDKs:

* [.NET (client-side)](#net-client-side)
* [Android](#android)
* [C++ (client-side)](#c-client-side)
* [Electron](#electron)
* [JavaScript](#javascript)
* [Node.js (client-side)](#nodejs-client-side)
* [React Web](#react-web)
* [Roku](#roku)

### .NET (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (client-side) code sample">

The client-side .NET SDK uses the `Common.Logging` framework. For an example configuration, read the [Common.Logging README](https://github.com/net-commons/common-logging#2-register-and-configure-commonlogging).

There are two important things to consider before you enable the DEBUG log level:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly contexts you create when you use this SDK.

</Details>

### Android

<Details summary="Expand Android code sample">

The Android SDK makes heavy use of Timber logging. Include Timber in your application to enable debug output or production logging. An example is shown below to enable debug output when the application is built with a debug configuration.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java">

```java
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    Timber.plant(new Timber.DebugTree());
}
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    Timber.plant(Timber.DebugTree())
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### C++ (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand C++ (client-side) code sample">

By default, there is no log output, but we provide a default logger you can enable. The SDK does not lock on any logging. Ensure that your implementation is thread safe.

Whether you use a custom logger or the default one, you must call use the `LoggingBuilder` to configure logging before the client is initialized. You cannot modify logging while the client is running.

If you use the default logger, you can configure how verbose it should be. The options are debug, info, warn, and error.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (native)">

```cpp
auto config = ConfigBuilder().Logging().Logging(
        LoggingBuilder::BasicLogging().Tag("ArbitraryLogTag").Level(LogLevel::kWarn)
   ).Build();
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (C binding)">

```c
LDClientConfigBuilder config_builder = LDClientConfigBuilder_New(key);

LDLoggingBasicBuilder basic_logging = LDLoggingBasicBuilder_New();
LDLoggingBasicBuilder_Tag(basic_logging, "ArbitraryLogTag");
LDLoggingBasicBuilder_Level(basic_logging, LD_LOG_WARN);

LDClientConfigBuilder_Logging_Basic(builder, basic_logging);

LDClientConfig config;
LDStatus status = LDClientConfigBuilder_Build(config_builder, &config);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also use your own custom log function.

First, implement the log backend interface. For C++, this means implementing the `ILogBackend` interface. If you are working with the C binding, define the callback functions to implement the log backend interface.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (native)">

```cpp
#include <launchdarkly/logging/log_level.hpp>
#include <launchdarkly/logging/log_backend.hpp>

using namespace launchdarkly;

class CustomLogger : public ILogBackend {
   public:
    /* Should return true if the specified level is enabled; in this example, return true to log all messages. */
    bool Enabled(LogLevel level) noexcept override { return true; }

    /* Forwards to stdout as an example, printing the log tag along with the message. */
    void Write(LogLevel level, std::string message) noexcept override {
        std::cout << GetLogLevelName(level, "unknown") << ": " << message << std::endl;
}
};
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (C binding)">

```c

/* Should return true if the specified level is enabled; in this example, return true to log all messages. */
static bool enabled(enum LDLogLevel level, void *user_data) {
    return true;
}

/* Forwards to stdout as an example, printing the log tag along with the message. */
static void write(enum LDLogLevel level, const char *msg, void *user_data) {
    printf("%d: %s\n", level, msg);
}
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Then, install the custom logger in the SDK's config:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (native)">

```cpp
// Make sure the <memory> header is included for std::make_shared
#include <memory>

auto config = config_builder.Logging().Logging(LoggingBuilder::CustomLogging().Backend(
        std::make_shared<CustomLogger>()));
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="C++ SDK v3.0 (C binding)">

```c
struct LDLogBackend backend;
LDLogBackend_Init(&backend);

backend.Write = write;
backend.Enabled = enabled;

/* You may optionally assign the UserData pointer, which will be passed into Write and Enabled. */
/* backend.UserData = &some_struct; */

LDLoggingCustomBuilder custom_logging = LDLoggingCustomBuilder_New();
LDLoggingCustomBuilder_Backend(custom_logging, backend);
LDClientConfigBuilder_Logging_Custom(builder, custom_logging);

LDClientConfig config;
LDStatus status = LDClientConfigBuilder_Build(builder, &config);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### Electron

<Details summary="Expand Electron code sample">

By default, the SDK uses the [`winston`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) package. There are four logging levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`. By default, `debug` messages are hidden.

To change the logging configuration, you can set `LDOptions.logger` to either another Winston instance or any object that implements the `LDLogger` interface. The `createConsoleLogger` function creates a minimal logger.

</Details>

### JavaScript

<Details summary="Expand JavaScript code sample">

In the default configuration, the SDK sends the output to the console and enables all log levels except `debug`.

To change the logging configuration, set `LDOptions.logger` to any object that implements the `LDLogger` interface and performs logging for the client. To learn more, read [LDOptions](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDOptions.html) and [LDLogger](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDLogger.html) in the SDK API docs.

</Details>

### Node.js (client-side)

<Details summary="Expand Node.js (client-side) code sample">

The client-side Node.js SDK offers several choices for logging.

In the default configuration, the SDK sends output to the console and enables all log levels except `debug`.

Versions 1.x of the SDK used the [`winston`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging package for the default configuration. Versions 2.0 and later do not have a dependency on `winston`. Instead, they write directly to the console by default.

For full control over logging behavior, you can set the [`logger`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/node-client-sdk/interfaces/LDOptions.html#logger) option to an object that implements the `LDLogger` interface. To learn more about the logger's requirements and methods, read [LDLogger](https://launchdarkly.github.io/node-client-sdk/interfaces/LDLogger.html). The `winston` package is compatible with this interface, so if you are already using a `winston` logger, you can pass it directly to the SDK.

You can use [`basicLogger`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/node-client-sdk/functions/basicLogger.html) for simpler control over logging behavior. Versions 2.x and earlier of the SDK do not support `basicLogger`.

This example shows how to use `basicLogger` to enable debug-level logging in your SDK configuration:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```javascript
const LaunchDarkly = require('launchdarkly-node-client-sdk');

const options = {
  logger: LaunchDarkly.basicLogger({
    level: 'debug',
  }),
};

const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize( 'client-side-id-123abc', user, options);

```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```ts
import * as LaunchDarkly from 'launchdarkly-node-client-sdk';

const logger: LaunchDarkly.LDLogger = ld.basicLogger({ level: 'debug' });
const options: LaunchDarkly.LDOptions = { logger: logger };

const client = LaunchDarkly.initialize( 'client-side-id-123abc', user, options);

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

Be aware of two considerations when enabling debug-level logging:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly users you create when you use this SDK.

</Details>

### React Web

<Details summary="Expand React code sample">

The React Web SDK relies on the JavaScript SDK for logging-related functionality. In the default configuration, the SDK sends the output to the console and enables all log levels except `debug`.

To change the logging configuration, set `LDOptions.logger` to any object that implements the `LDLogger` interface and performs logging for the client. The `basicLogger`, available in the JavaScript SDK, produces such an object.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { basicLogger } from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

export default withLDProvider({
  clientSideID: 'client-side-id-123abc',
  options: {
    logger: basicLogger({level: 'debug'})
  }
})(App);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more, read [LDOptions](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDOptions.html) and [LDLogger](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-client-sdk/interfaces/LDLogger.html) in the JavaScript SDK API docs.

</Details>

### Roku

<Details summary="Expand Roku code sample">

The Roku SDK's logging feature is configurable. You can set different log levels, or use a custom logging backend with one of the two supported custom loggers.

Those loggers are:

* [Legacy API custom logger for the Roku SDK](#legacy-api-custom-logger-for-the-roku-sdk)
* [SceneGraph API custom logger for the Roku SDK](#scenegraph-api-custom-logger-for-the-roku-sdk)

#### Log levels in the Roku SDK
---

You can configure the SDK log level. For example, to set the level to `info`:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="BrightScript">

```brightscript
config.setLogLevel(LaunchDarklyLogLevels().info)

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The SDK supports the following Levels:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="BrightScript">

```brightscript
LaunchDarklyLogLevels().error
LaunchDarklyLogLevels().warn
LaunchDarklyLogLevels().info
LaunchDarklyLogLevels().debug
LaunchDarklyLogLevels().none
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

#### Legacy API custom logger for the Roku SDK
---

Here is an example of the legacy API custom logger:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Legacy custom logger (BrightScript)">

```brightscript
function CustomLogger() as Object
    return {
        log: function(level as Integer, message as String)

            print level message
        end function
    }
end function

config.setLogger(CustomLogger())

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

#### SceneGraph API custom logger for the Roku SDK
---

Here is an example of the SceneGraph API custom logger:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="CustomLogger.xml">

```xml
<!-- /components/CustomLogger.xml -->

<component name="CustomLogger" extends="Task">
    <interface>
        <field id="log" type="assocarray" alwaysNotify="true"/>
    </interface>

    <script type="text/brightscript" uri="pkg:/components/CustomLogger.brs"/>
</component>
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="CustomLogger.brs">

```brightscript
REM /components/CustomLogger.brs

function init()

    m.messagePort = createObject("roMessagePort")


    m.top.observeField("log", m.messagePort)

end function

function mainThread() as Void
    while (true)

        msg = wait(0, m.messagePort)


        if type(msg) = "roSGNodeEvent" then
            if field = "log" then
                value = msg.getData()

                print value.level value.message
            end if
        end if
    end while
end function
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To use the logger, create the SceneGraph logger node, and then:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="BrightScript">

```brightscript
config.setLoggerNode(myLoggerNode)

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

## Server-side SDKs

This feature is available in the following server-side SDKs:

* [.NET (server-side)](#net-server-side)
* [C/C++ (server-side)](#cc-server-side)
* [Go](#go)
* [Java](#java)
* [Node.js (server-side)](#nodejs-server-side)
* [PHP](#php)
* [Python](#python)
* [Ruby](#ruby)
* [Rust](#rust)

### .NET (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand .NET (server-side) code sample">

The .NET SDK has four logging levels: `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, and `Error`. By default, the lowest enabled level is `Info`, so `Debug` messages are hidden. There are two important things to consider if you enable the `Debug` level:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly contexts you create when you use this SDK.

The .NET SDK sends log output to `Console.Error` by default. The [`ConfigurationBuilder.Logging`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-server-sdk/api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server.ConfigurationBuilder.html#LaunchDarkly_Sdk_Server_ConfigurationBuilder_Logging_) method and the [`LaunchDarkly.Logging`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-logging/) API allow you to change the output destination and log level.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
using LaunchDarkly.Logging;
using LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server;

var config = Configuration.Builder("sdk-key-123abc")
    .Logging(
        Components.Logging(Logs.ToWriter(Console.Out)).Level(LogLevel.Debug)
    )
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

The destination could be another logging framework, such as the .NET Core `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` API in this example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C#">

```csharp
using LaunchDarkly.Logging;
using LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Server;

var config = Configuration.Builder("sdk-key-123abc")
    .Logging(Logs.CoreLogging)
    .Build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more about logging configuration and adapters for other logging frameworks, read the documentation for [`LaunchDarkly.Logging`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/dotnet-logging/).

All log messages from the SDK are tagged with a logger name, indicating the category of messages. If you use a logging framework like `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` or NLog, you can use these names to filter the output:

* `LaunchDarkly.Sdk`: general messages about the operation of the SDK client.
* `LaunchDarkly.Sdk.DataSource`: messages about how the SDK client receives feature flag data, such as if the connection to LaunchDarkly has been interrupted.
* `LaunchDarkly.Sdk.DataStore` (or more specific names like `LaunchDarkly.Sdk.DataStore.Redis`): messages about how the SDK client stores feature flag data, such as if you are using a database integration.
* `LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Evaluation`: messages about unusual conditions during feature flag evaluation, such as if a feature flag could not be evaluated because its configuration is invalid.
* `LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Events`: messages about analytics events, such as if event data could not be sent to LaunchDarkly due to a network problem.

Before version 6.0, the .NET SDK had different logging behavior:

* The mechanism for specifying a log destination was the [`Common.Logging`](https://github.com/net-commons/common-logging#2-register-and-configure-commonlogging) framework.
* If you did not specifically configure a log destination using `Common.Logging`, logging was disabled by default.
* The main logger name was `LaunchDarkly.Client.LdClient`.

</Details>

### C/C++ (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand C/C++ (server-side) code sample">

By default, there is no log output, but we provide a default logger you can enable. The SDK does not lock on any logging. Ensure that your implementation is thread safe.

Whether you use a custom logger or the default one, you must call `LDConfigureGlobalLogger` before the client is initialized. You cannot modify logging while the client is running.

If you use the default logger, you can configure how verbose it should be.

For example, setting it to `LD_LOG_TRACE` produces the most verbose output, which may be useful in troubleshooting.

Here is an example:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
LDConfigureGlobalLogger(LD_LOG_TRACE, LDBasicLogger);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

You can also use your own custom log function:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="C/C++">

```c
static void
myCustomLogger(const LDLogLevel level, const char *const text)
{
    printf("[%s] %s\n", LDLogLevelToString(level), text);
}

LDConfigureGlobalLogger(LD_LOG_TRACE, myCustomLogger);

```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### Go

<Details summary="Expand Go code sample">

The Go SDK uses a logging abstraction that can write to a [`log.Logger`](https://pkg.go.dev/log#Logger) or anything with a compatible interface. This adds a system of log levels similar to logging frameworks on other platforms. There are four logging levels: `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, and `Error`.

By default, all levels of messages are enabled except `Debug`. You can tell the SDK to enable more or fewer levels, to send the output to a different destination, or to disable logging.

Here's how:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v6.0">

```go
import (
    "log"
    "os"
    ldlog "github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common/v3"
    ld "github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6"
    "github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v6/ldcomponents"
)

var config ld.Config

loggers := ldlog.NewDefaultLoggers()

// Send output to a file
file, _ := os.Create("app.log")
loggers.SetBaseLogger(log.New(file, "", log.LstdFlags))

config.Logging = ldcomponents.Logging().
    Loggers(loggers).
    MinLevel(ldlog.Warn) // Change minimum level to Warn (Debug and Info are disabled)

// Or, disable logging
config.Logging = ldcomponents.NoLogging()
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Go SDK v5.x">

```go
import (
    "log"
    "os"
    ldlog "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-sdk-common.v2"
    ld "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5"
    "gopkg.in/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.v5/ldcomponents"
)

var config ld.Config

loggers := ldlog.NewDefaultLoggers()

// Send output to a file
file, _ := os.Create("app.log")
loggers.SetBaseLogger(log.New(file, "", log.LstdFlags))

config.Logging = ldcomponents.Logging().
    Loggers(loggers).
    MinLevel(ldlog.Warn) // Change minimum level to Warn (Debug and Info are disabled)

// Or, disable logging
config.Logging = ldcomponents.NoLogging()
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

There are two things to consider if you enable the `Debug` log level:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly contexts you create when you use this SDK.

</Details>

### Java

<Details summary="Expand Java code sample">

In version 5.10.0 and higher, the Java SDK allows you to specify a destination for logging using the [`LDConfig.Builder.logging`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.launchdarkly/launchdarkly-java-server-sdk/latest/com/launchdarkly/sdk/server/LDConfig.Builder.html#logging(com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.subsystems.ComponentConfigurer)) method and the [`com.launchdarkly.logging`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-logging/) API.

If you do not specify a destination, the default behavior depends on the version of the SDK:
* In versions 5.10.0 and earlier, the default destination is [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/). SLF4J has its own configuration mechanisms for determining where output will go, and for filtering by level and/or logger name. It will not generate any output unless you have provided a configuration. For an example of using SLF4J with a simple console logging configuration, visit an SLF4J-specific version of [hello-java](https://github.com/launchdarkly/hello-java/tree/slf4j-logging).
* Starting with version 6.0.0, the SDK does not require SLF4J. Instead, it detects whether the application is already using SLF4J. If the SLF4J classes are present in the classpath, then it sends log output to SLF4J by default. If the SLF4J classes are not present in the classpath, then it sends log output to `System.err` by default.

Here is an example of configuring log output to go to the standard output stream (`System.out`), and enabling `DEBUG` level:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Java SDK v5.10.x and later">

```java
import com.launchdarkly.logging.*;
import com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.*;

LDConfig config = new LDConfig.Builder()
  .logging(
    Components.logging(Logs.toStream(System.out)).level(LDLogLevel.DEBUG)
  )
  .build();
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

To learn more about logging configuration and adapters for other logging frameworks, read the documentation for [`com.launchdarkly.logging`](https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-logging).

All log messages from the SDK are tagged with a logger name, indicating the category of messages. If you use a logging framework like SLF4J, you can use these names to filter the output:

* `com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.LDClient`: This is for general messages that do not fall into any other categories.
* `com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.LDClient.DataSource`: This is for messages related to how the SDK obtains feature flag data. Usually, this means messages about the streaming connection to LaunchDarkly, but if you use polling mode or file data instead, the SDK logs those messages under this name.
* `com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.LDClient.DataStore`: This is for messages related to how feature flag data is stored. For example, database errors appear here if you are using a database integration.
* `com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.LDClient.Evaluation`: This is for messages related to feature flag evaluation.
* `com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.LDClient.Events`: This is for messages related to analytics event processing.

In versions of the SDK before 5.0, logger names were not standardized and were sometimes the names of Java classes that are not part of the public API, but they consistently had a package prefix of either `com.launchdarkly.client.` or `com.launchdarkly.eventsource.`

There are two important things to consider before you enable the `DEBUG` log level:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly contexts you create when you use this SDK.

</Details>

### Node.js (server-side)

<Details summary="Expand Node.js (server-side) code sample">

The Node.js SDK offers several choices for logging.

In the default configuration, the SDK sends output to the console and enables all log levels except `debug`.

Pre-6.0 versions of the SDK used the [`winston`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging package for the default configuration. Versions 6.0 and later write directly to the console by default.

For full control over logging behavior, you can set the [`logger`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-core/packages/sdk/server-node/docs/interfaces/LDOptions.html#logger) option to an object that implements the `LDLogger` interface. To learn more about the logger's requirements and methods, read [LDLogger](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-core/packages/sdk/server-node/docs/interfaces/LDLogger.html).

You can use [`basicLogger`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-core/packages/sdk/server-node/docs/functions/basicLogger-1.html) for simpler control over logging behavior. Versions 5.x and earlier of the SDK do not support `basicLogger`.

This example shows how to use `basicLogger` to enable debug-level logging in your SDK configuration:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v8.x (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from '@launchdarkly/node-server-sdk';

const logger: ld.LDLogger = ld.basicLogger({
  level: 'debug',
  destination: console.log,
});

const options: ld.LDOptions = { logger: logger };
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v7.x and earlier (JavaScript)">

```javascript
const ld = require('launchdarkly-node-server-sdk');

const options = {
  logger: ld.basicLogger({
    level: 'debug',
  }),
};
```

</CSTab>
<CSTab label="Node.js SDK v7.x and earlier (TypeScript)">

```ts
import * as ld from 'launchdarkly-node-server-sdk';

const logger: ld.LDLogger = ld.basicLogger({
  level: 'debug',
  destination: console.log,
});

const options: ld.LDOptions = { logger: logger };
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

There are two important things to consider before you enable debug-level logging:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly users you create when you use this SDK.

</Details>

### PHP

<Details summary="Expand PHP code sample">

The PHP SDK uses [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog). All loggers are namespaced under `LaunchDarkly`.

There are two important things to consider before you enable the DEBUG log level:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly contexts you create when you use this SDK.

You can pass a custom logger to the SDK by using the configurable `logger` property:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="PHP">

```php
$client = new LaunchDarkly\LDClient("sdk-key-123abc", ["logger" => new Logger("LaunchDarkly", [new ErrorLogHandler(0, Level::Debug)])]);
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### Python

<Details summary="Expand Python code sample">

The Python SDK uses Python's built-in [logging library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html).

Here's how to enable the debug log level:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="Python">

```python
ld_logger = logging.getLogger("ldclient")
ld_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>

There are two important things to consider before you enable the debug log level:

- Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
- Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly users you create when you use this SDK.

### Ruby

<Details summary="Expand Ruby code sample">

The Ruby SDK uses Ruby's built-in [Logger class](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html). All loggers are namespaced under `[LDClient]`.

There are two important things to consider before you enable the DEBUG log level:

1. Debug-level logs can be very verbose. We do not recommend using debug logging in high-volume environments.
2. Debug-level logs include sensitive information, including LaunchDarkly contexts you create when you use this SDK.

    You can pass a custom logger to the SDK by using the configurable `logger` property:

    <CodeSample>
    <CSTab label="Ruby">

    ```ruby
    log = ::Logger.new($stdout)
    log.level = ::Logger::DEBUG
    config = LaunchDarkly::Config.new({logger: log})
    client = LaunchDarkly::LDClient.new("sdk-key-123abc", config)
    ```

    </CSTab>
    </CodeSample>

## Edge SDKs

This feature is available in the following edge SDKs:

* [Cloudflare](#cloudflare)
* [Vercel](#vercel)

### Cloudflare

<Details summary="Expand Cloudflare code sample">

In the default configuration, the SDK sends output to the console and enables all log levels except debug.

For full control over logging behavior, you can set the logger option to an object that implements the LDLogger interface. To learn more about the logger's requirements and methods, read [LDLogger](https://launchdarkly.github.io/js-core/packages/sdk/cloudflare/docs/interfaces/LDLogger.html).

This example shows how to use BasicLogger to enable debug-level logging in your SDK configuration:

<CodeSample>
<CSTab label="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { BasicLogger, LDOptions } from '@launchdarkly/cloudflare-server-sdk';

const options: LDOptions = {
  logger: new BasicLogger({ level: 'debug', }),
};
```

</CSTab>
</CodeSample>
</Details>

### Vercel
